        "title": "Flurry of 911 calls has been coming from ICE detention site near San Antonio. The calls, ranging from suicide attempts to sexual abuse, paint a picture of inhumane conditions inside the South Texas ICE Processing Center in Pearsall.",
        "selftext": "By Stephanie Koithan\n\nA detention center southwest of San Antonio used to hold people arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has experienced a flurry of 9-1-1 calls originating from inside, Wired magazine reports.\n\n\n\nThe emergency calls, sometimes made by staff and sometimes by detainees or their visiting family members, paint a picture of dire conditions inside, immigrant advocates argue. The subject matter of the calls ranged from suicide attempts and allegations of sexual abuse to health issues faced by pregnant inmates, according to Wired's reporting.\n\n\"Conditions at the South Texas ICE Processing Center ('Pearsall') are broadly punitive, as they have been throughout its two-decade history under the management of private prison company GEO Group,\" immigrant rights advocacy group RAICES told the Current in an emailed statement.\n\n\n\n\"Near-capacity detention rates in recent weeks have only threatened to exacerbate long-held concerns and compound violations of the federal government’s own standards,\" RAICES continued. \"Medical care is inadequate, disorganized and indifferent to urgency. Food is limited, heavily rationed and often expired. And inattentive guards enable systemic obstacles to qualified legal counsel for people in detention, which have only worsened under this administration based upon RAICES’ observations.\"\n\n\n\nThe South Texas ICE Processing Center, located less than an hour's drive from the Alamo City  at 566 Veterans Drive in Pearsall, is operated by private prison giant GEO Group. The facility is one of the nation's largest such detention sites and has a capacity of 1,900 inmates, comprised of both men and women.\n\n\n\nThe Current reached out to the South Texas ICE Processing Center in Pearsall for a response to the claims of abuse but received no response by press time.\n\n\n\nWired reports that from January through May, more than 80 emergency calls originated from the facility, including several regarding suicide attempts. One 36-year-old man reportedly swallowed 20 over-the-counter pills, while another detainee, 37, ingested cleaning chemicals and a third, 41, was found cutting himself. \n\n\n\nOther calls involved pregnant women bleeding or suffering severe pain, according to the magazine's data dive. ICE detention is linked to heightened rates of pregnancy complications — both for the child and mother — according to research by the peer-reviewed JAMA Network of medical publications.\n\nWhile official ICE policy generally discourages detaining pregnant individuals, ICE booked 158 pregnant, postpartum and nursing people over a six-month period ending early last spring, according to federal data.\n\n\n\nJonathan Ryan, a San Antonio immigration attorney and former CEO of RAICES, told the Current that the 9-1-1 calls emanating from the Pearsall Center are a tactic by GEO Group to avoid cutting into profit margins by administering in-house medical treatment.\n\n\n\n\"You always have to remember that these are for-profit detention facilities,\" Ryan said. \"These are corporations that are profit-based, and medical care is expensive. And so even if they have the facilities to provide medical care, if they are able to offload those services to the local community, they're going to do that because that's more money in their pockets.\"\n\n\n\nRyan continued: \"You do everything you can to avoid spending money on the people who are detained there. And that's a race to the bottom in terms of safety and sanity and health for anybody who is unfortunate enough to be stuck inside of those facilities.\"\n\n\n\nThe JAMA Network's report showed a high rate of preventable deaths at ICE detention facilities nationwide due to inadequate medical care. Most deaths were people under 43 with no co-morbidities, and one-half of the deaths were due to preventable causes, such as COVID-19 and suicide.\n\n\"Systematic substandard care has been identified as a factor associated with these deaths, including lack of recognition of severe illness, medical staff dismissal of concerns about individuals’ health, and delays in activating external emergency care,\" the report states.\n\n\n\nRyan, who's dealt with cases at the Pearsall facility since it opened in 2005, said he's frequently heard of its on-site medical facility prescribing water for a slew of health problems.\n\n\n\n\"But you also see in some instances over-medication, and that particularly is in terms of things like psychotropic medicine,\" Ryan said. \"And I've on many occasions seen my clients zombified in those facilities because they're being pumped up with psychotropic medicines that the facility uses in order to practically render catatonic anyone who doesn't follow their orders and doesn't comply with their regimen of rules in the facilities.\"\n\nThe number of 9-1-1 calls originating from the South Texas ICE Processing Center tripled in March, according to Wired. However, the magazine noted that a number of factors could have contributed to the jump, including worsening conditions, increased willingness to dial 9-1-1 or a surge in population. In one week, dispatchers fielded 11 separate calls from the facility.\n\n\n\nIn one such call, a woman complained that her husband detained inside had been too weak to get out of bed all day and \"they have not helped,\" Wired reports. Another dispatch from the facility in March was due to a report of sexual abuse identified as \"staff on detainee,\" according to the story.\n\n\n\nIn addition to 9-1-1 calls made from the facility, detainees' family members have taken to leaving negative Google reviews in apparent hope their cries for help reach the world at large.\n\n\n\n\"The detention is really bad, \\[nobody\\] hear\\[s\\] us, \\[today\\] all the inmate\\[s\\] stop\\[ped\\] eating food,\" Respina Saze wrote a week ago in a review of the Pearsall site. “Detainees have launched a hunger strike demanding justice and urgent review of their cases. \\[T\\]here is no \\[human\\] right\\[s\\]! And \\[nobody\\] answer\\[s.\\] \\[W\\]e are worry about our \\[family\\] member.\"\n\n\"This place does not know what it’s doing,\" said another one-star review, left a month ago by Tami Dube. \"\\[Y\\]ou call\\[,\\] ask questions and you get transferred to phone numbers that don’t even exist. People get sick or hurt and they’re not medically attended to. You try to bond them out and people have to wait 6+ hours just to be turned away 2 hours before closing.\"\n\n\n\nAs of this week, ICE is holding a record 59,000 detainees throughout the country as part of President Donald Trump's aggressive immigration crackdown, according to CBS News. Historical data gathered by the Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization covering the criminal justice system, indicates that it's the largest population of immigrant detainees in the nation's history.\n\n\n\nOf the 204,297 people ICE booked into detention since the start of the fiscal year, 65% have no criminal convictions and 93% have no violent convictions, according to data compiled by CATO Institute, the libertarian think tank. Among those who do have prior convictions, 53% fall into the categories of immigration, traffic-related offenses and non-violent vice crimes.",

        "title": "They Didn’t Kill Remote Work Because It Failed; They Killed It Because Big Oil Was Dying",
        "selftext": "Remote work was never the issue. It worked. People were getting more done. They were less stressed, more focused. The skies were cleaner. Families were spending real time together again. Traffic vanished, the air was breathable, and for one brief moment, people saw what life could be if we weren’t shackled to a gas tank.\n\nAnd then the reversal came. Executives, media talking heads, and even your friends started parroting the same garbage:\n“It’s bad for culture.”\n“We need face time.”\n“Back to normal.”\n\nBut here’s the truth: it had nothing to do with culture.\nIt was oil.\nPlain and simple.\n\nWhen We Stopped Driving, They Started Panicking\n\nIn 2020, oil demand collapsed. U.S. gas usage dropped to the lowest level since 1969. [EIA, 2020]. ExxonMobil posted a $22 billion loss. Chevron lost $11 billion. BP slashed its dividend for the first time in a decade.\n\nThese companies weren’t just losing money—they were watching their entire model break.\nAnd guess what caused it?\nYou. Not driving.\n\nSo they fought back. Not with commercials. Not with honesty. But with influence. The American Petroleum Institute increased its lobbying spend in 2021. Quiet money went to think tanks like the Heritage Foundation, the American Enterprise Institute, and the Cato Institute—all of which have taken millions in fossil fuel donations. [Greenpeace Exxon Files, SourceWatch]. And from there came the messaging war: “Remote work is lazy,” “We’re losing productivity,” “You can’t innovate from home.”\n\nIt wasn’t a coincidence. It was coordinated.\n\nJoe Manchin. Ron DeSantis. Trump. The Usual Oil Puppets.\n\nSenator Joe Manchin, Democrat in name only, took over $1.5 million from fossil fuel donors. He’s personally profited from a coal company run by his family. In 2022, he demanded federal workers end remote work and return to their desks. That’s not leadership. That’s someone cashing a check.\n\nRon DeSantis, darling of the right and oil lobbyist wet dream, took nearly $10 million from fossil-fuel-aligned PACs between 2020 and 2022. His stance? Force schools and agencies open, kill off remote infrastructure, and attack climate regulation at every turn. His backers include the Uihlein family, owners of major shipping and fuel logistics operations, and Richard Uihlein in particular is known for pouring cash into anti-remote, pro-industry candidates.\n\nDonald Trump? That man was practically raised by Exxon. His Secretary of State? Rex Tillerson, former CEO of ExxonMobil. His rollback of EPA standards? A gift to Chevron. His push to “reopen the economy” during a mass-death pandemic? A desperate move to resuscitate oil demand.\n\nAnd then there’s the megaphone crew:\nJoe Rogan is the perfect example of how culture and power intertwine. Rogan isn’t an oil shill per se—but he’s hosted dozens of right-wing guests who are. He platformed Jordan Peterson (funded by Koch-aligned think tanks), Ben Shapiro (backed by The Daily Wire, partially funded by fossil-aligned billionaires), and Vivek Ramaswamy, who’s directly invested in fossil fuels. In his interviews, Rogan consistently talks about how remote work “feels lazy,” that people “need routine,” that cities need to “get back to normal.”\n\nHe’s not pushing oil. But the oil lobby doesn’t need a spokesman—they need a vibe.\nAnd Rogan sells it well.\n\nHe helps normalize the same “back to work” energy that fills gas stations and coffers.\n\nThe Media Was Paid to Sell You the Lie\n\nYou started seeing anchors, especially on CNBC and Bloomberg—networks flooded with car, airline, and fossil fuel ads—asking if remote work had “gone too far.” Meanwhile, oil ads ran every commercial break. Shell. Chevron. BP. Telling you they were “part of the solution.”\n\nNo. They were the reason for the problem. They wanted you back in traffic. Burning gas. Sitting in rush hour. Buying $6 lattes. Pumping dollars into a machine that profits every time you suffer.\n\nAnd it worked. Not because it made sense—but because it was louder. They outspent the truth.\n\nRemote Work Was a Revolution—and They Crushed It\n\nWhen people stayed home, productivity rose. Families got time back. Pollution dropped so dramatically NASA satellites captured it. [NASA, 2020].\nLos Angeles had smog-free skies.\nDelhi saw blue for the first time in decades.\n\nAnd the people who benefited most from this new world?\n\t•\tThe disabled.\n\n\t•\tThe immunocompromised.\n\n\t•\tParents of young kids.\n\n\t•\tAnyone without money for daily commuting, \n\nparking, or “office clothes.”\n\nSo what happened? The system—fueled by oil, defended by politicians, and normalized by media—ripped it away. All so Chevron could stop losing money.\n\nAnd we let them.\n\nWhat You Can Do Before They Take More\n\nYou’re not powerless. But you do need to start seeing who’s really behind the curtain. Here’s what matters:\n\t\n•\tCall out the names: Joe Manchin. Ron DeSantis. The Kochs. The Heritage Foundation. They don’t work for you—they work for fossil fuels.\n\n\t•\tSupport companies that stay remote-first.\n\n\t•\tVote like your lungs and freedom depend on \nit, because they do.\n\n\t•\tDon’t let the Rogans of the world shape the \nvibe unchecked.\n\n\t•\tAsk who benefits every time someone tells you “it’s time to return.”\n\n\nThey needed your engine running to keep their heart beating.\n\nWe had a glimpse of something better. And they killed it. Not because it was broken. But because it worked.\n.\n",

            "body": "I'm somewhat knowledgeable about the various pressures that resulted in a widespread pushback against remote work. I've been practicing law long enough to remember the GFC's impact to commercial real estate and how that shifted the mergers and acquisitions bargaining power in ways that few predicted, and even fewer thought it could happen so rapidly. It's no surprise that I keep a close eye on certain markets. Everything listed is all accurate, though if there were one I'd label as primary, it was because the sheer number of office space renewals that were coming due. Tldr below. \n\n\nMost all the leases that could be punted with short term extensions or \"act of god\" clauses have done so to the limit. These are typically negotiated as 20 year leases, so some were signed during the real estate boom from the mid 2000's. Tenants were asking for unprecedented discounts/concessions and some were simply not interested in renewing at all. This wasn't going to be a localized matter where some investors lose this round, maybe win the next. This rapid devaluation of assets would have potential to spread negative consequences to every industry and most all households. \n\n\nThere's a reason that political parties can't agree that water is wet, yet have explicitly or tacitly approved of return to work policies. There's simply so much money tied up in it that it created a consensus of business leaders and those with political power to act jointly to preserve something closer to the status quo than sit idle. Politicians would be accused of repeating Nero's mistakes and there aren't many business leaders who want things to change. That's a lot of momentum behind solutions like bailouts or return to work policies.\n\n\nThe historically predictable commercial lease market was about to be reset and that would have financially crippled lending, thus the markets, and there's little safety net left at the Fed. Business and politics had incentive to proactively soften any shakeup in bargaining power between the owners and tenants. Commercial real estate is what I imagine people picture when mentioning something is \"too big to fail.\" I don't like to say that, but facts care very little for what I like. \n\n\nEvidence supports that allowing this market to undergo significant changes will hurt everyone to some degree, so even minimum wage workers without any investments or jobs in cities have reason to plug their nose and support artificially propping up certain sectors. Return to work was what business and politics largely agreed upon as the best solution. \n\n\nIt's not hyperbole to say that the commercial real estate market, if allowed to enter freefall downward, would cause something akin to the Great Depression, maybe worse. Big law firms get paid well to stay on top of these things, and there were a lot of very scary projections that were rapidly shifting from speculation to reality. These aren't the types who jump at everything the Fed says or even sweat administration changes. When they are getting very seriously worried, it was time to actually worry.\n\n\nThese leases are meant to be very stable investments and that focus is in the parties minds. Accordingly, temporary market instability is not going to move the needle too much. It's a different story if there are massive vacancy rates with no indication that things will change. Remote work was that rare event that would have crumbled commercial leases as they constantly underbid each other to attract tenants. This isn't a situation where it's just Blackrock and other big investors that take the hit though. The markets are too tightly intertwined. \n\n\nWhether this was the natural product of capitalism or created and implemented by K Street isn't something I pretend to know. Unfortunately, it means one issue becomes a contagion problem for more than just those invested or otherwise connected to the industry. It's political suicide to let a large sector crash. Commercial real estate leases is a market measured in trillions. If we thought 2008 was bad... \n\n\nThe failure of one previously stable asset would have forced large companies to drastically lower their projected cash flow, among other things. Asset holders often borrow as much as possible because fully utilizing leverage is often more profitable. Borrowing power is determined by many factors, including reasonably projected revenues. This exposes the banks to risk as they also make assumptions about default rates, etc. While the corner hot dog vendor predictably sees a downturn, so does the rural diner that would presumably be more insulated from the impact.\n\n\nWith interest rates high, there was no was to refinance out of this and the consequences would have brought the financial system to a near standstill, especially since the Fed \"fired all its bullets\" when it had to combat the lockdowns. There's little room left to stimulate the economy again. The freefall of most all asset prices would be felt by most everyone. Rampant inflation is the only other alternative, and that's even less politically popular. Return to work is perhaps the only viable solution to those with wealth and power.\n\n\nTldr: if commercial vacancy rates skyrocket, it's a going to cause a huge, long lasting financial meltdown that makes the COVID dip look like a hiccup. Because the pain hurts almost everyone instead of just wealthy investors, business and politicians had huge incentives to preserve the value and stability of this market and pushing people to return to work accomplishes this.",

It's insurance, oil, real estate. On the RE side, they can't have commercial RE going down and RTO solves 2 issues, keeping the price of commercial and residential RE up. On the driving side, car insurance agencies and oil lobbies are motivated to keep people in the office. For the politicians, they need to keep the balance sheets looking good. Also, if people stat home and have energy,  they have energy to think, organize and question why we do things the way we do and even maybe start businesses which we can't have. Almost everyone in power right now has an incentive to RTO so they'll hide it behind culture or socializing or productivity or something but really it's about self interest. RTO doesn't have one answer, it has many different ones. It's trying to fight against a hydra and only focusing on the head in the middle.

In fact global oil consumption only dropped by 9% in 2020 from the previous year of 2019, and has steadily increased every year to where we are now exceeding 2019 by 5%...\n\nBefore you make such an assertion perhaps you should really do some research.\n\nAs for your \"more productive\" claim lol, yes there are some people who can perform better without the distractions and stress of the workplace environment. However, this accounts for an extremely small percentage of people working from home because it takes a mind who is motivated and has initiative and for the most part people are children and lack these qualities therefore they need to be under constant supervision.",

A new accountability program and signed deal between traditional and charter schools, the compact establishes an Office of Charter Schools and promotes, thanks to  the newly formed Philadelphia School Partnership, a parochial school agenda.  Philadelphia School Partnership is a fund raising, school assessment group that seeks to convert low-performing schools into corporate factories and religious institutions.\n\n**Both the Gates and BCG plans for Philly are right on target with the Philadelphia School Partnership’s corporate/voucher plot.**\n\nThe Philadelphia School Partnership’s (PSP) corporatist/voucher/charter connections run deep. One PSP board member, **Janine Yass**, founded the Boys’ Latin School in 2007, where lawmaker Anthony Williams’ former staffer and BAEO member Dawn Chavous is now secretary of its board. Along with Kevin Chavous (DFER/BAEO leader and cousin to Dawn), Chris Whittle (formerly of Edison Schools), and Jeanne Allen (past Corbett adviser), **Janine Yass sits on the board of directors for the Center for Education Reform (CER)**, a pro-choice group launched in D.C. in 1993. In fact, Yass’ love affair with CER goes back to at least 2006, when she, past Bush Secretary of Education Rod Paige, New York City Schools Chancellor Joel Klein, Sallie Mae founder Al Lord, then-Indiana Republican state senator Teresa Lubbers, and others were celebrated for anti-public school accomplishments.\n\n**Janine is married to Susquehanna International Group’s Jeff Yass, a big funder of anti-public school groups across the country.** Along with Jeff’s partner Arthur Dantchik, Janine Yass donated $1,000 to Dan Harvell’s unsuccessful 2006 run for the GOP primary in House District 7, South Carolina. Blogger Gervais S. Bridges has found that, in this race, 86% of Harvell’s campaign funding came from out-of-state voucher supporters. Americans for Limited Government’s Howard Rich, who currently sits with Jeff Yass on the Cato Institute’s board, also tossed $1,000 to Harvell’s voucher campaign.\n\nsource:  [In the City of Corporate Love and Beyond: The Boston Consulting Group, Gates, and the Filthy Rich – Common Errant (btownerrant.com)](http://btownerrant.com/2012/05/18/in-the-city-of-corporate-love-and-beyond-the-boston-consulting-group-gates-and-the-filthy-rich/) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wn02lgv3d5s81.png?width=1225&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bb3df82388b5369eb6a7a6e8eca966de2d6a558\n\n**BCG’S SISTER CITES: THE CORPORATE SCHOOL PLAN FOR CLEVELAND AND PHILLY**\n\nThis month, Cleveland’s Mayor Frank Jackson is attempting to persuade the Ohio state legislature to buy into a corporate school transformation plan that BCG and others have been setting in motion since 2009.\n\n**In Cleveland, BCG has utilized the same slash-and-burn tactics as in Philly.**\n\nTo set up the kill, BCG’s 2009 Cleveland plan  (PDF ), which also included “reports” on school turnarounds from Education First and theme schools from the Council of the Great City Schools, doesn’t detail cost-saving strategies.\n\n**BCG AT THE PEARLY GATES**\n\nIn Illinois, BCG sold itself to the **Gates Foundation**, Joyce Foundation, Education First, and several sell-out leaders to help launch Advance Illinois. On the Advance Illinois board, BCG’s senior partner and managing director Marin Gjaja joined former Illinois governor Jim Edgar and State Farm’s Edward B. Rust, Jr., the former chair of the Business Roundtable’s Education Initiative and a McGraw-Hill board member, who has been on the public schools’ enemy list for years. In January 2012, just months after Advance Illinois aided in Stand for Children’s legislative buyout by spreading reform propaganda, BCG’s Shalini Unnikrishnan addressed the Illinois Joint Interim Task Force on Accountable Schools concerning the Illinois school report card, alongside Advance Illinois’ Robin Steans, daughter of Harrison Steans, the chairman of the executive committee at Financial Investments Corporation who sat on Mayor Daly’s charter school-expanding Renaissance School Fund board.  BCG revamped the Illinois school report card in 2011 by organizing 60 state-wide focus groups, but this wasn’t the firm’s first Illinois rodeo. In fact, in 2005, as CEO Arne Duncan applauded, the Gates Foundation paid BCG and the American Institutes for Research $2.3 million to devise a managing “portfolio” for the Chicago Public Schools.\n\n**Gates rehired BCG to write the proposal (PDF) for North Carolina’s Race to the Top bid**, after he bankrolled the firm’s 2007 North Carolina District and School Transformation plan.\n\n**In 2009, in order to win a $100 million Gates grant to set up an anti-teacher plan in Florida, Hillsborough County Schools hired, with Gates Foundation money, BCG to do focus groups**, survey teachers and administrators, and write up the grant proposal. For community engagement meetings in February and May 2010, besides BCG and Gates representatives, several members of the United Way were on hand, too, as they are in Philly. Hillsborough won the Gates Foundation Empowering Effective Teachers Grant, and the Hillsborough County Teachers Association willingly signed on.\n\n**BCG won the gig to develop the “teacher effectiveness” system for Hillsborough, too.** BCG and Gates have been involved in “boosting teacher effectiveness” in Prince George’s County Public Schools in Maryland and “improving student outcomes” in the Los Angeles Unified School District.\n\n**According to currently available tax records, since 2008 Gates has paid BCG $35.5 million.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sigq4ftke5s81.png?width=1450&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c00185da642a244b101df5b180f997eab63c5d75\n\n**Boston Consulting Group: Another Dark Horseman**\n\nWord went out today that immediately after Arkansas decided to make Little Rock Schools non-public, the **Walton family** called a \"focus group\" meeting \"in conjunction with the Boston Consulting Group. This is worse than finding the slender man in the back of your family portrait. For a public school system, this is finding the grim reaper at your front door. And he's not selling cookies.\n\nThe Boston Consulting Group is often referred to as \" management consulting group.\" That's not entirely accurate. BCG is one of The Big Three consulting groups-- the other two are McKinsey and Bain. People love working there, and the people who work there are recruited heavily from the very toppest universities. These are the guys that Fortune 500 companies call for help making money. Forbes lists them as America's 112th largest private company. Gutting and stripping school districts does not even require a tenth of their power or attention.

I haven’t read the whole post yet &amp; will tomorrow, so if you said anything about the conservatives anti-trans youth political BS &amp; connection to this please forgive me. I smooth, sleepy ape 🦧 I promise my story connects to BCG’s goal to destroy public schools!\n\nI’m happy to elaborate more, but in short I have a 13 year old trans son who is the most beautiful human in the world. I grew up in Florida so I’m kinda obsessed with Desantis, Don’t Say Gay, and all of the conservative hate targeting trans kids just like mine. If I lived in Texas they’d try to take my kid away from me. I hate this place.\n\nIn doing my research, I came across the theory that Florida’s law is basically a ploy to encourage a multitude of lawsuits against the public school district, eventually bankrupting the school system &amp; funneling funds into private Christian (aka white) schools. And the casualties are trans kids. LIKE MINE. \n\nMy Master’s degree is in clinical psychology &amp;  all of the research shows that laws like these, even just TALKING about laws like these raises trans youth suicide rates. They’re already killing themselves at disproportionate rates. I don’t just want my kid to live, ALL trans kids deserve to live &amp; thrive!!!\n\nThis connection you’ve made is blowing my mind because now it’s more personal than it’s ever been for me. It’s my baby &amp; all of the kids like him. They’re throwing trans kids under the bus &amp; it’s literally life or death. \n\nI DON’T HAVE WORDS FOR MY RAGE AT THESE FUCKERS. I feel RC’s last tweet in my soul.\n\nThank you OP for this connection. It fuels my anger but also gives me a little peace for some strange reason ❤️",

Well the cops or mayor leaked the info to some wannabe biker douche, and I shit you not 800-1000 people showed up to counter protest us with assault rifles, body armor, American flags, etc. They literally marched through town and surrounded our small group of families with kids, my gf and I, and some other folks from the community. They went from just screaming at us, to ripping signs from our hands and trying to steal all our things, to flat out assaulting multiple of us right in front of the entire towns police force(like 6 guys). I got punched in the face, thrown in the street and hit in the leg with a bat or something. My gf got sucker punched at the same time along with multiple others, even a teenage girl that was under 18 was attacked.\n\nThe cops didn't do a god damn thing and we were honestly lucky to even get out of there and back to out house without anyone following us. There's multiple videos of what happened, but the only real thing to come of it was a middle school teacher lost her job for being seen on a video yelling racist things directly to a girl.

I wanted to be a teacher once, I took the teach grant and taught in one of those black neighborhood schools you speak about. I wont name specifics to avoid doxing myself but the place was falling apart and the other teachers did not care. Many of my 4th grade students could not read. The school was getting plenty of money in fact it was getting most of the grant money in the district but the local superintendent was using it to buy stuff for themself and for useless bloat positions for their friends. While that may sound familiar to the topic its only coincidence as the individual went straight from academia to the position. No pitstops at bcg.\n\n I did not make the year and I quit and repaid the grant. Common core is a crime against education. It took leaving the states and going to other countries to see just how bad it is, I have had to basically re-learn math and chemistry from scratch. I showed my indian roomates my high school math textbook and they told me to my face I was scammed they had learned the same content in 6th grade. You will find no ally of public schools in this ape. \n\nSchool choice should be paramount what alot of public school supporters seem to forget is that the greatest champions of school choice are minority and ethnic populations. An IEP in my class had the mother come to me  and say she wished she had been able to send her daughter to tge next school over which had a more comprehensive special ed program But she could not. This is getting really close to political and I hate that because I have railed against it myself. But your entire post which while I am really glad for the info and encourage further digging comes with the supposition that public schools are some noble thing that people should be railing to defend. The BCG did not start this decline, it has been festering and coming for decades if you look into it. But they are certainly taking advantage of it and they should be looked over with a fine toothed comb. But dont pretend they are responsible for a mess that has too many factors involved going back too many years.  End rant I have said my piece.",

It was all treasonous and traitorous from top to bottom.\n\nThe primary aspects of the Trump coup were to have favorable governors and Secretaries of State declare \"election irregularities,\" which would give cover for state legislators to provide a slate of illegal, false electors. This is the most critical component and thoroughly undermines the ignorant doofus theory you posit above. When the false elector scheme failed, Trump resorted to pressuring governors and SoS' directly, to illegally manufacture votes from whole cloth.\n\nIn light of those failures, Trump pressured VP Pence to refuse to acknowledge electors from the swing states that Biden won, to either push for a contingent election in the House or simply reject the false electors. When Pence refused, that is when the Stop the Steal riot was instigated. The goal was to create as much confusion, chaos, and violence as possible and halt the certification of the electors, using said violence as a pretext for clinging to power. The last ditch effort being that Pence would have no choice but to succumb to the pressure and declare irregularities, such that the electoral votes could not be counted at all.\n\nFurthermore, there's no reason whatsoever to assume Trump didn't know he lost. \n\n* VP Mike Pence told Trump “he had seen no evidence of fraud\" that would change the outcome of the election. \n* Senior Justice Department leaders told Trump multiple times that there was no evidence that supported support his claims of election fraud. \n* The Director of National Intelligence told Trump the intelligence community did not find any evidence of interference that “would change the outcome of the election.”\n* The DHS told Trump “that there was no evidence any voting system had been comprised” and that \"the 2020 election was the most secure in American history.\" \n* Senior White House attorneys told Trump there was “no evidence” of election fraud.\n* Trump's senior campaign staff told Trump he only had a 5-10% chance of winning his re-election, and only if he won ongoing vote counts and litigation in Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin. \n* State legislators and officials who supported Trump repeatedly told him that his election fraud claims were “false.”\n* State and federal courts assessed all of his lawsuits alleging election fraud and ruled “his allegations were meritless.\"",

The words, actions and timing of the administration and Harris both confirm it. \n\n\nWhen Biden put Harris in charge of the border in March 2021, he said she would be part of a “full team” that would “deal with the problem here at home” and “in terms of in-country.” He added that “it’s not her full responsibility and job, but she’s leading the effort.”\n\nSo Biden’s appointment of Harris as the administration’s point person on immigration was about as comprehensive as it could be.

Thiel, who made his $21 billion fortune in venture capitalism, has described himself as a libertarian. But his political spending habits reveal his authoritarian ambitions.  In 2016, at a time when many elites dismissed Donald Trump’s chances of winning the White House, Thiel [donated](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/16/technology/peter-thiel-donald-j-trump.html) $1.25 million to Trump’s campaign and delivered a [speech](https://time.com/4417679/republican-convention-peter-thiel-transcript/) at the Republican National Convention lamenting the absence of big tech in government. By the 2022 midterms, Thiel’s influence had grown considerably. He poured over [$20 million](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/14/technology/republican-trump-peter-thiel.html) into the campaigns of far-right Republican candidates, many of whom amplified Trump’s lies about the 2020 election and laid the groundwork for the January 6 insurrection. One of Thiel’s most prominent beneficiaries was JD Vance, now the vice president, whose political rise was essentially [engineered](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/us/jd-vance-father-mentors.html) by Thiel.\n\n&gt;Mr. Vance met Peter Thiel, who co-founded PayPal and two other companies, when Mr. Thiel spoke at Yale in 2011. Mr. Vance has described Mr. Thiel’s talk about the negative impact of cutthroat competition among elites as the most significant moment of his Yale education. Luke Thompson, a political consultant and a close friend of Mr. Vance, described Mr. Thiel as Mr. Vance’s most important mentor, adding that the two men talk frequently. Mr. Vance has called Mr. Thiel an important sounding board.\n\n&gt;Mr. Thiel paved Mr. Vance’s way in the world of venture capitalism, and bankrolled Mr. Vance’s campaign for Ohio’s open Senate seat in 2022, which he won. He provided $15 million in financing, a large sum for an individual donor, and went with Mr. Vance to Mar-a-Lago to ask for Mr. Trump’s endorsement.\n\nWhile Thiel is perhaps best known as a founding member of the PayPal mafia, he deserves far more scrutiny as the founder and chairman of the shadowy tech giant Palantir Technologies. Despite branding itself as “[not a data company](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-is-not-a-data-company/),” Palantir builds powerful data surveillance tools that enable governments, law enforcement, and corporations to collect, integrate, and analyze vast amounts of personal data of citizens and customers. Well before the Trump administration, Palantir had embedded itself deep within the federal government, securing [contracts](https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/11/leaked-palantir-doc-reveals-uses-specific-functions-and-key-clients/) with the CIA, DHS, NSA, FBI, the CDC, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, Special Operations Command, West Point, the Joint IED-defeat organization and Allies, the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children by 2013. \n\nSince then, Palantir has secured its largest contracts from the U.S. Department of Defense, which has [spent](https://spacenews.com/pentagon-boosts-budget-for-palantirs-ai-software-in-major-expansion-of-project-maven/) more than a billion dollars to expand the company’s AI-driven targeting system known as the [Maven Smart System](https://defensescoop.com/2024/05/29/palantir-480-million-army-contract-maven-smart-system-artificial-intelligence/). \n\n&gt;“The MAVEN Smart System (MSS) by Palantir along with National Geospatial Agency (NGA) Broad Area Search – Targeting (BAS-T) uses AI generated algorithms and memory learning capabilities to scan and identify enemy systems in the Area of Responsibility (AOR). MAVEN fuses data from various Intelligence Surveillance &amp; Reconnaissance (ISR) systems to identify areas of interests,” according to the release.\n\nYet with minimal public oversight or transparency, it remains [unclear](https://blogs.icrc.org/law-and-policy/2024/09/04/the-risks-and-inefficacies-of-ai-systems-in-military-targeting-support/) how accurate these AI-driven systems truly are—or whether human analysts are consistently verifying the information before decisions are made. This raises serious concerns about the potential for error, misidentification, and accountability in automated warfare.\n\nFurther reading:\n\n* “‘The machine did it coldly’: Israel used AI to identify 37,000 Hamas targets,” [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/03/israel-gaza-ai-database-hamas-airstrikes)\n* “Palantir Supplying Israel With New Tools Since Hamas War Started,” [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-10/palantir-supplying-israel-with-new-tools-since-hamas-war-started)\n\n#Surveillance state\n\nIn March, Trump signed an [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/stopping-waste-fraud-and-abuse-by-eliminating-information-silos/) directing the federal government to share data across agencies, casting the “silos” that protect our information as barriers to eliminating “waste, fraud, and abuse.” We [now know](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/technology/trump-palantir-data-americans.html) that Palantir has secured contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars to build a centralized, government-wide, searchable “mega-database” containing sensitive information on virtually everyone in the country.\n\n&gt;Mr. Trump has not publicly talked about the effort since. But behind the scenes, officials have quietly put technological building blocks into place to enable his plan. In particular, they have turned to one company: Palantir, the data analysis and technology firm…The push has put a key Palantir product called Foundry into at least four federal agencies, including D.H.S. and the Health and Human Services Department. Widely adopting Foundry, which organizes and analyzes data, paves the way for Mr. Trump to easily merge information from different agencies, the government officials said.\n\nThe lucrative contracts were funneled to Palantir via Elon Musk’s DOGE agency as far back as April, when [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/palantir-doge-irs-mega-api-data/) reported that the company had begun building a “mega API” for accessing IRS records. According to [ProPublica](https://projects.propublica.org/elon-musk-doge-tracker/), at least four top DOGE staffers previously worked at Palantir, including the Senior Adviser to the Director of DOGE (whoever that may be now) and the new Chief Technology Officer at the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nAs Keep_Track [warned](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1k0hxys/trump_and_musk_are_building_an_aidriven/) earlier this year, the convergence of DOGE’s massive [data extraction](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/15/nx-s1-5355896/doge-nlrb-elon-musk-spacex-security) and Palantir’s powerful pattern-matching software could allow the Trump administration to systematically target dissenters and marginalized communities. Those seeking gender-affirming care or abortions in states where such services are banned could face surveillance or prosecution. So could protesters opposing ICE, or journalists who publish stories critical of the regime, or the average American who makes an insulting social media post about the president.\n\nEveryone from lawmakers to former employees are sounding the alarm:\n\n&gt;\"The ultimate concern is a panopticon of a single federal database with everything that the government knows about every single person in this country,\" [Cody Venzke, senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, told [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/doge-collecting-immigrant-data-surveil-track/).] \"What we are seeing is likely the first step in creating that centralized dossier on everyone in this country.\"\n\n&gt;“Data that is collected for one reason should not be repurposed for other uses,” [Linda Xia, a signee who was a Palantir engineer until last year, said in a [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/technology/trump-palantir-data-americans.html) interview.] “Combining all that data, even with the noblest of intentions, significantly increases the risk of misuse.”\n\n&gt;“The unprecedented possibility of a searchable, ‘mega-database’ of tax returns and other data that will potentially be shared with or accessed by other federal agencies is a surveillance nightmare that raises a host of legal concerns, not least that it will make it significantly easier for Donald Trump’s Administration to spy on and target his growing list of enemies and other Americans,” [Democratic members of Congress [wrote](https://www.finance.senate.gov/ranking-members-news/wyden-ocasio-cortez-demand-answers-from-palantir-about-plans-to-build-irs-mega-database-of-american-citizens) in a letter to Palantir CEO Karp.]\n\nWe don’t have to look far to see the real-world implications of such a wide-ranging central database of people. The roving bands of [masked thugs](https://www.foxla.com/video/1663436)—who we should refuse to call federal agents as long as they refuse to identify themselves—kidnapping brown people off the streets are powered by Palantir software. The company has [partnered](https://theintercept.com/2017/03/02/palantir-provides-the-engine-for-donald-trumps-deportation-machine/) with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) since 2014, when the Obama administration awarded the company a $41 million contract to build and maintain an intelligence system (called ICM) that tracks the personal and criminal records of both legal and undocumented immigrants.\n\n&gt;ICM funding documents analyzed by The Intercept make clear that the system is far from a passive administrator of ICE’s case flow. ICM allows ICE agents to access a vast “ecosystem” of data to facilitate immigration officials in both discovering targets and then creating and administering cases against them. The system provides its users access to intelligence platforms maintained by the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and an array of other federal and private law enforcement entities. It can provide ICE agents access to information on a subject’s schooling, family relationships, employment information, phone records, immigration history, foreign exchange program status, personal connections, biometric traits, criminal records, and home and work addresses.\n\nAccording to internal company messages seen by [404 Media](https://www.404media.co/leaked-palantirs-plan-to-help-ice-deport-people/), Trump’s mass deportation push has super-charged Palantir’s surveillance network as it takes the lead in identifying and locating immigrants for ICE to deport, with the ability to track people who overstay their visas. Another project involves software to “support the logistics of deportation,” which essentially translates to prison databases that overlay information on who is detained, where they are detained, and how to most efficiently transport detainees between facilities and ultimately out of the country. \n\nMeanwhile, lawmakers of both parties are [cashing in](https://www.quiverquant.com/congresstrading/stock/PLTR) on Palantir’s expanding panopticon. Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna (CA) has purchased tens of thousands of dollars of Palantir stock since Trump took office. So have Republican Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (GA) and Rob Brenahan (PA). \n\nAnd, to top it all off, Trump’s chief immigration policy advisor, Stephen Miller, [owns](https://www.pogo.org/investigations/stephen-miller-conflicts-of-interest) between $100,000 and $250,000 in Palantir stock. The man orchestrating the expansion of a surveillance state designed to violate people's civil and human rights is directly profiting from the machinery he’s helping to build.\n\n---\n\nThe creation of a centralized, AI-enhanced database of personal information is not a distant dystopia—it is already underway. As CEO Alex Karp recently [boasted](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/palantir-ceo-hails-musk-doge-132116257.html?guccounter=1) on a quarterly earnings call, “Palantir is here to disrupt and make the institutions we partner with the very best in the world and, when it’s necessary, to scare enemies and on occasion kill them.” When that partner is Donald Trump, and his enemies are law-abiding Americans who dare to dissent, Palantir becomes more than just a tech company. It becomes a threat to democracy itself.",

They revoke your green card for false statements and fraud and start deportation proceedings.\n\nEtc etc. Its about creating fear that causes self-censorship and obedience in advance. They don't need to punish all of us - just enough that we silence ourselves.",

I guess the closest thing\nto a successful attempt to creating a libertarian utopia is when a bunch of libertarians\ndecided to move and try to take over some smaller town Grafton in New Hampshire\nas a [\"Free Town Project\"](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/21534416/free-state-project-new-hampshire-libertarians-matthew-hongoltz-hetling)\n(later changed to \"Free State Project\"), and ruined it with their reckless governance.\n\nLike for instance getting rid of public garbage collection.\nAnd with no mandatory garbage collection, of course they got problems\nwith wild bears walking around peoples' houses (in addition to some idiots deliberately\nfeeding wild bears, but hey in a libertarian society nobody should be\nable to force people to stop doing what they want...).\n\nThere is a book about it with title [\"A libertarian walks into a bear\"](https://www.allbookstores.com/search?type=advance&amp;author=&amp;title=A+Libertarian+Walks+Into+a+Bear&amp;isbn=&amp;binding=&amp;dateyear_operator=during&amp;dateyear=).\n\n-----\n\nJ.D.

There is a video [Who is Peter Thiel?](https://youtu.be/SKY5pOcEn4U?t=616) (in German but with English subtitles available)\nfrom two years ago that goes into who Peter is and what he have done, and J.D. Vance is covered as part of that.\n\nAnother noteworthy mention is that [Some more news](https://www.youtube.com/@SMN) also included J.D. Vance in their video\n[Peter Thiel and his dorky little goons](https://youtu.be/4WfHXt1ZQhg?t=146) from one year ago.\nSome more news is truly amazing in both the depth and the volume they produce.

If you are in the position to support my work, I have a [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/RusticGorilla), [venmo](https://venmo.com/code?user_id=2974196418215936837), and a [paypal](http://paypal.me/CobbAdrienne) set up. No pressure though, I will keep posting these pieces publicly no matter what - paywalls suck.\n\n* NOTIFICATIONS: You can [signup](http://eepurl.com/gKUtUH) to receive a (somewhat) monthly email with links to my posts.\n\n---\n---\n\nSix of the nine justices of the Supreme Court—the highest court in the United States, with the power to declare actions of the Legislative and Executive branch unconstitutional—were (or are) members of a powerful organization called the Federalist Society. The group is a collection of conservative and libertarian lawyers who are often chosen by Republican presidents to ascend to the federal bench. \n\nLeonard Leo, executive vice president of the Federalist Society, advised both George W. Bush and Donald Trump on the confirmation process for Supreme Court justices, leading to Roberts’ and Alito’s placement as well as the success of Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett. Clarence Thomas, too, is a member of the Federalist Society.\n\n---\n\nAs a non-profit, the Federalist Society is not required to report individual donations to the IRS. What we know of donors to the Federalist Society is what the organization itself chooses to publicize.\n\nI went through the group’s last three [annual reports](https://fedsoc.org/annual-report) (2017-2019, the most recent available) detailing their donors. Many choose to remain anonymous.\n\n*This list is not comprehensive; see the annual reports link above for the full lists.*\n\n##Large corporations:\n\n* Google: Gave at least $100,000 every year\n* Koch Industries: Gave at least $100,000 every year\n* Walmart: Gave at least $100,000 in 2017 and $50,000-$99,999 in 2018\n* Chevron Corporation: Gave $50,000-$99,999 every year\n* Facebook: Gave $50,000-$99,999 in 2018 and 2019, gave $25,000-$49,999 in 2017\n* Pfizer, Inc.: Gave $50,000-$99,999 every year\n* Microsoft: Gave $50,000-$99,999 in 2017 and 2018\n* GlaxoSmithKline: Gave $50,000-$99,999 in 2018 and $25,000-$49,999 in 2017.\n* T-Mobile: Gave $25,000-$49,999 in 2018 and 2019\n* Verizon: Gave $25,000-$49,999 every year\n* Exxon Mobil Corporation: Gave $10,000-$24,999 every year\n\n---\n\n##Foundations:\n\n**The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation**, gave at least $100,000 every year: top funder for groups affiliated with charter schools; Pro-Trump attorney Cleta Mitchell sits on the foundation's board of directors \n\n&gt;[New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/08/09/the-big-money-behind-the-big-lie): Based in Milwaukee, the private, tax-exempt organization has become an extraordinary force in persuading mainstream Republicans to support radical challenges to election rules—a tactic once relegated to the far right. With an endowment of some eight hundred and fifty million dollars, the foundation funds a network of groups that have been stoking fear about election fraud, in some cases for years. Public records show that, since 2012, the foundation has spent some eighteen million dollars supporting eleven conservative groups involved in election issues.\n\n**E.L. Craig Foundation**, gave at least $100,000 every year: Created by the founder of TAMKO Building Products; headed by his daughter, Ethelmae Humphreys, who served on the boards of the libertarian think tank Cato Institute; Humphreys and her children financially supported Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and donated $850,000 to Club for Growth Action Missouri to support Sen. Josh Hawley.\n\n**The Hugh and Hazel Darling Foundation**, gave at least $100,000 every year: A legal education foundation in California. UCLA Law School features a legal library in their name.\n\n**Donors Trust**, gave at least $100,000 every year: Donors Trust is one of the biggest conservative dark money groups. “[Now-deceased CEO Whitney] Ball [says](https://web.archive.org/web/20150724184044/http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/02/donors-trust-donor-capital-fund-dark-money-koch-bradley-devos) she travels all over the country courting wealthy conservatives and libertarians, and attends Koch donor retreats and Cato ‘shareholder’ meetings.

I think I'm constantly evaluating the media and messages I receive (including comments on reddit). I like pointing out bias or a common fallacy so I can spot a disingenuous argument pretty quickly. Some people are dissecting every word she (or anyone) says hoping they can pick up on some catch phrase they've inherently misunderstood. The media they consume has allowed them to think that they're actually offering a sound debate. In reality, it's embarrassing to have to argue with someone who is so clearly lacking critical thinking.

        "selftext": "Hi everyone, \n\nI’m finding that people don’t seem to know the details about how the Kochs attacked climate science and I can’t post this in r/50501 anymore and my post in r/climate change got removed (I didn’t read the description so I think it was the wrong sub, my bad) so I’m posting here so you don’t have to read the 450+ pages - Dark Money is 10 years old but it explains exactly how we ended up here - if anyone has another detailed source that is more recent, please let me know. \n\nI will have to do two more posts but my first post in r/50501 is still there and linked above. \n\n———-\n\n# **Corporate lobbying [xvi] legal organizations, lobbyists** [xviii]\n\nBy 1990, enterprising conservative and libertarian activists were wearing a path to Wichita to pitch their proposals to Charles Koch in hopes of his patronage. [178] In 1991, William “Chip” Mellor, III, a former Reagan administration lawyer, proposed an aggressive, right-wing public interest law firm that would litigate against government regulations in favor of “economic liberty”. [178] \n\n&gt; Charles Koch said, “Here’s what I’m going to do. I’ll give you up to $500,000 a year for three years, each year, but you’ll have to come back each year and demonstrate that you’ve met these milestones that you’ve set out to accomplish and I will evaluate it on a yearly basis, and there’s no guarantees.” [178] The legal group, the **Institute for Justice**, went on to bring numerous successful cases against government regulations, including campaign-finance laws, several of which reached the Supreme Court. [178]\n\n## From 1998-2008, Koch Industries spent more than $50 million on lobbying. [1998-2008, 179]\n\nAnother member of the Koch network, Richard DeVos ($5.7 billion) [no date, 21], cofounder of Amway, Michigan-based MLM empire, led similar efforts to take political action and change laws after pleading guilty to defrauding the Canadian government (from 1965-1978 [285]) of $22 million in customs duties in 1982. [20]\n\nIn 1980, Richard DeVos and Jay Van Andel, cofounders of Amway, became the top spenders on behalf of Ronald Reagan’s presidential candidacy. [285] By 1981, Richard DeVos was the finance chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC), which Jay Van Andel headed the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. [285]\n\nAmway gave $2.5 million to the Republican Party during the 1994 midterm elections, which was the largest known soft money donation from a corporation in the country’s history. [287]\n\nRichard Junior, known as Dick, married the other royal family of Michigan’s Dutch Reformed community, Betsy Prince, whose father, Edgar Prince, founded an auto parts manufacturing company that sold for $1.35 billion in cash in 1996, while her brother, Erik Prince, founded the global security firm Blackwater, which reporter Jeremy Scahill described as “the world’s most powerful mercenary army”. [287]\nBetsy DeVos eventually became the chairwoman of Michigan’s Republican Party.\n\nThe DeVos family funded legal challenges to various campaign finance laws for years. In 1997, Betsy DeVos became a founding member of the James Madison Center for Free Speech, a nonprofit organization whose only goal was to end all restrictions on money in politics. [288] Its honorary chairman was Senator Mitch McConnell, a savvy and prodigious fundraiser. [288] By designating itself a nonprofit charitable group, the Madison Center enabled the DeVos Family Foundation and other supporters to take tax deductions for subsidizing long-shot lawsuits that might never have been attempted otherwise. [289]\n\n&gt; Betsy DeVos wrote, “My family is the largest single contributor of soft money [e.g. for “issue” ads] to the national Republican Party … We do expect some things in return”. [289]\n\n&gt; As a Republican running for office in Kentucky in the 1970s, McConnell admitted, “[A] spending edge is the only thing that gives a Republican a chance to compete”. [288] In a Senate debate on proposed campaign finance restrictions, McConnell repeatedly told colleagues, “If we stop this thing, we can control the institution for the next 20 years”. [288]\n\n# **Politically tinged nonprofit spending** [xvi] think tanks, academic programs, front groups [xviii] \n\n### Between 1998-2008, Charles Koch’s private fund, the **Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation**, made more than $48 million in tax-deductible grants, primarily to groups promoting his political views. [179] The Claude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation, controlled by Charles and his wife Liz, with two company executives and an accountant, similarly made more than $28 million in tax-deductible grants. [179] David Koch’s fund, the **David H. Koch Charitable Foundation**, made more than $120 million in tax-deductible grants - many to cultural and scientific projects rather than political. [179]\n**Academic programs - the “intellectual track within the DC-New York corridor” to influence elite opinion with op-ed pieces, lawsuits, and expert think tank studies** [235-236]\n\n&gt; Charles Koch wanted to focus on “attracting youth” because “this is the only group that is open to a radically different social philosophy” [68] through educational indoctrination, with free-market curricula and even video games promoting his ideology pitched to prospects as young as grade school. [68]\n\n&gt; He believed that government interference in the economy was what had caused the last Great Depression. [210] “Bankers, brokers and businessmen” had been falsely blamed. [210] The true culprits to him were Herbert Hoover and Franklin Roosevelt, whom he regarded as dangerous liberals. [210]\n\n&gt; “He advocated funding private institutes within prestigious universities, where influence over hiring decisions and other forms of control could be exerted by donors while hiding the radicalism of their aims. [69] “It would be necessary to use ambiguous and misleading names, obscure the true agenda, and conceal the means of control. This is the method that Charles Koch would soon practice in his charitable giving, and later in his political actions” [69]\n\n&gt; “In order to alter the direction of America, they realized they would have to “influence the areas where policy ideas percolate from: academia and think tanks”” [71] “Cumulatively, the many-tentacled ideological machine they built came to be known as the Kochtopus”. [71]\n\nBy 1981, the Kochs’ donations of $30 million largely funded the **Mercatus Center**, a think tank located on the George Mason University campus, a public university, advertised as “the world’s premier university source for market-oriented ideas - bridging the gap between academic ideas and real-world problems”. [182] \n\nClayton Coppin, who taught history at George Mason and compiled Charles’s political activities for Bill Koch, characterized the Mercatus Center as “a lobbying group disguised as a disinterested academic program” that enabled Charles to “have a tax deduction for financing a group, which for all practical purposes is a lobbying group for his corporate interest”. [183]\n\nIn the same building as the Mercatus Center was another heavily Koch-funded institute, chaired by Charles Koch, the Institute for Humane Studies. [183] Its founder had called taxes “theft”, welfare “immoral”, and opposed court-ordered remedies to racial segregation. [183] The aim of the IHS was to cultivate and subsidize the next generation’s libertarian scholars. [183] \n\n### &gt; Charles reportedly demanded better metrics with which to monitor students’ political views. [183] To the dismay of some faculty members, applicants’ essays had to be run through computers in order to count the number of times they mentioned the free-market icons Ayn Rand and Milton Friedman. [183] Students were tested at the beginning and the end of each week for ideological improvement. [183] The institute also housed the Charles G. Koch summer internship program, a paid fellowship placing students who shared the Kochs’ views in like-minded nonprofit groups, where they could join the libertarian network. [183]\n\nBy 2004, the Wall Street Journal dubbed the **Mercatus Center** as “the most important think tank you’ve never heard of” and noted that 14 of the 23 regulations that President George W. Bush placed on a “hit list” had been suggested by Mercatus scholars. [186]\n\n&gt; Thomas McGarrity, a law professor at the University of Texas who specialized in environmental issues, argued that “Koch has been constantly in trouble with the EPA and Mercatus has constantly hammered on the agency”. [187] \n\n&gt; One environmental lawyer who clashed repeatedly with the Mercatus Center dismissed it as a lobbying show dressed up as a nonprofit, calling it “a means of laundering economic aims”. [187] The lawyer explained the strategy: “You take the corporate money and give it to a neutral-sounding think tank,” which “hires people with pedigrees and academic degrees who put out credible-seeming studies. But they all coincide perfectly with the economic interests of their funders”. [187]\n\n&gt; For example, a top official at the Mercatus Center made a pro-smog argument that “by blocking the sun, smog cut down on cases of skin cancer. She claimed that if pollution were controlled, it would cause up to 11,000 additional cases of skin cancer”. [187]\nWendy Gramm, wife of Senator Phil Gramm, head of Mercatus’ Regulatory Studies Program, pushed for the Enron Loophole, exempting the type of energy derivatives from which Enron profited from regulatory oversight. [188] Senator Gramm crafted a deregulatory bill made to order for Enron and Koch, called the Commodity Futures Modernization Act. [188] In 2001, Enron collapsed in a heap of bogus financial statements and fraudulent accounting practices. [188] But Wendy Gramm had pocketed up to $1.8 million from Enron the year after arguing for the loophole. [188] It emerged that before going under, Enron had made substantial campaign contributions to Senator Gramm, while its chairman, Kenneth Lay, had given money to the Mercatus Center. [188]\n\nBy 2008, **George Mason University** was both the largest single recipient of Koch funds for higher education and the largest research university in Virginia [189]\n\n### In 1998, the American Petroleum Institute colluded with top oil executives and conservative think tank officials on a secret plan to spend $2 million to confuse the press and the public about the growing scientific consensus on global warming. [255] The plan called for recruiting skeptical scientists and training them in public relations so that they could act as spokesmen, thereby adding legitimacy and cover to the industry’s agenda. [255]\n\n### Kert Davies, the director of research at Greenpeace, the liberal environmental group, spent months trying to trace the funds flowing into a web of nonprofit organizations and talking heads, all denying the reality of global warming as if working from the same script. [251] What he discovered was that from 2005-2008, a single source, the Kochs, poured almost $25 million into dozens of different organizations fighting climate reforms. [251] His research showed that Charles and David had outspent, by a factor of three, what was then the world’s largest public oil company, ExxonMobil [251] In a 2010 report, Greenpeace crowned Koch Industries the “kingpin of climate science denial”. [251]\n\n### The first peer-reviewed academic study on climate science denial by Robert Brulle, Drexel professor of sociology and environmental science, discovered that between 2003-2010, more than half a billion ($558 million) dollars had been spent on a massive “campaign to manipulate and mislead the public about the threat posed by climate change”, funded by 140 conservative foundations - in essence, a corporate lobbying campaign disguised as a tax-exempt philanthropic endeavor. [251]\n\n### The money went to think tanks, advocacy groups, trade associations, other foundations, and academic and legal programs. [251]\n\n### However, 3/4 of the funds for this “climate change counter-movement” were untraceable. [252] Brulle said, “Powerful funders are supporting the campaign to deny scientific findings about global warming and raise public doubts about the roots and remedies of this massive global threat. At the very least, American voters deserve to know who is behind these efforts.” [252]\n\n### But by the time Obama took office, some had gone even more underground. Rather than funding directly, a growing number of conservative foundations and donors had begun directing their contributions through an organization called DonorsTrust. [253] Founded in 1999 by Whitney Ball, a West Virginia libertarian who had overseen development of the Koch-founded Cato Institute, it made contributions appear to go to a “donor-advised fund” rather than the more controversial groups she would later distribute the funds into. [253] This way, the donors’ names were erased from the money trail - meanwhile, the donors retained the same if not bigger charitable tax deductions. [253]\n\nA similar liberal donor-advised fund, the Tides Foundation, existed, but DonorsTrust as the conservative response soon had 4 times the funds and a far more strategic board. [253] Its directors consisted of the top officials of some of the most important organizations in the conservative movement, including the American Enterprise Institute, the Heritage Foundation and the Institute for Justice, the libertarian legal center whose start was funded by Charles Koch. [253]\n\nIn 2010, its single largest grant was $7.4 million to the Americans for Prosperity Foundation (AFP), chaired by David Koch. [253] This grant was 40% of the AFP’s funding that year, belying the notion that it was a genuine grassroots organization. [253]\n\n## Dr. James Baker, former head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said in 2005, “There’s a better scientific consensus on [global warming] than on any issues I know - except maybe Newton’s second law of thermodynamics”. [255] \n\n",

        "selftext": "The purpose of this post is to answer a question I have seen many users on this sub ask over the last few weeks: who is pushing all this Afrikaner stuff in the United States?\n\nThe answer is an Afrikaner lobbying and civil society group known in South Africa as [Afriforum](https://afriforum.co.za). Together with Afriforum is another organization known as [Solidarity](https://www.solidariteit.co.za), which is an Afrikaner trade union. Afriforum and Solidarity are not political parties, but are well-resourced and effective parts of the civil society advocating for the interests of Afrikaners. Together they both fall under the umbrella of the '[Solidarity Movement](https://solidaritymovement.co.za)'.\n\nThe rest of this article explores the history of these organizations, their growing prominence in South Africa in recent years, their ideology and their beliefs.\n\n# Apartheid-era White Politics\n\nTo understand where these organizations come from, you have to start in the 80s.\n\nDuring Apartheid, the party that governed under the White only elections was called the [National Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Party_(South_Africa)) ('the Nats'). These are the people who designed and enforced Apartheid.\n\nThere were other parties that stood in opposition to the Nats. An early example were the United party of Jan Smuts. But towards the end of Apartheid, reformists from the United Party and other liberal parties coalesced into a liberal party known as the [Progressive Federal Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Federal_Party) ('the Progs'). These are White people who opposed Apartheid but participated in Parliamentary politics, like [Helen Suzman](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/06/helen-suzman-mandela-forgotten-saint-anti-apartheid).\n\nIn the 80s, the Nats began a process of trying to reform Apartheid by introducing some basic representation for Indian and Coloured people (but not Black people). They wanted to have a '[Tricameral Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricameral_Parliament)' where [Indians ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_South_Africans)and [Coloureds ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coloureds)would be able to have their own representatives. When the talk of reforms began, a group in the National Party broke away in resistance to these reforms. They formed [**the Conservative Party**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(South_Africa)).\n\nThe Conservative Party quickly overtook the Progs as the official opposition. During the 1992 referendum to end Apartheid, they campaigned for No which won 30% of the vote (White South Africans), which is about the same as their level of support in Parliament.\n\nThe Conservative Party represented White people to the right-wing of the National Party of Both and De Klerk. The opposed the end of Apartheid. They were far-right Afrikaner Nationalists.\n\nDuring the negotiations to end Apartheid, members of the Conservative Party were [involved in the assassination the leader of South Africa's Communist Party](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/36866.stm), Chris Hani.\n\nThere were people even further to the right of the Conservative Party, like the Afrikaner Weerstandbeweging (AWB). These right-wing terrorists were [literally neo-Nazis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaner_Weerstandsbeweging) who formed militias to terrorize negotiators and ordinary citizens.\n\nSo there was an entire political spectrum to the right of the National Party, that ran from the Conservative Party to neo-Nazis like the AWB. Many of these forces coalesced into militias united under the Afrikaner Volksfront, led by Constand Viljoen, a former military general.\n\nThe Volksfront attempted to assist the dictator of the Tswana Bantustan, Lucas Mangope, to maintain his rule in the face of pro-democracy/pro-ANC protests. The AWB (neo-Nazis) got involved against Mangope's wishes. Mangope wanted Viljoen and the more 'moderate' militia elements, often led by former army generals. Many senior leaders in the Volksfront were also wary of the AWB. The situation escalated dramatically and the [entire plan failed spectacularly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Bophuthatswana_crisis#Attempted_takeover). \n\nViljoen then left the Volksfront and formed a political party which participated in the transition to democracy and the first elections. The party that Viljoen formed was called the Freedom Front. \n\nThe Freedom Front would eventually absorb those Afrikaner right-wing leaders who didn't want to run around with AWB neo-nazi militias, but who nonetheless were to the right of the National Party. Many of the leaders and members of the Conservative Party would [end up in the Freedom Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Mulder).\n\nThe Freedom Front was thus the successor to the Conservative Party. It was founded by right-wing Afrikaners, from Parliamentarians to former defense officials acting as militia leaders during the tumultuous transition to democracy. But it stopped short of going into the territory of the militant neo-Nazis like the AWB. \n\nUnlike the Conservative Party, the Freedom Front participated in the 1994 elections and ran on the idea of creating an Afrikaner ethnic enclave within South Africa, known as a *Volkstaat.* Charitably, this would be something like Afrikaner Quebec. Less charitably, it was an attempt to create a White Afrikaner ethnostate within the borders of South Africa, and any talk of co-existence was a pretext to declaring independence from South Africa and establishing an Afrikaner Republic. \n\nIn the final years of Apartheid and the first years of democracy, White South African politics thus went like this:\n\n* Liberals who opposed Apartheid voted for the Progressive Freedom Party, which rebranded as the Democratic Party.\n* Conservatives who supported Apartheid and opposed reforms and its end voted for the Conservative Party which evolved into the Freedom Front.\n* Most White South Africans voted for the National Party led by FW de Klerk. This was the party the implemented Apartheid, but also, ultimately, negotiated its end. By the standards of Apartheid-era White South Africa, it was the 'center'.\n* The far-far-right nutjobs were involved in militias and neo-Nazi type groups which were quickly brought under control.\n* Genuine left-wing Whites voted for the ANC.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the National Party collapsed. Its leaders would scatter amongst many parties (including the ANC), but its membership moved almost entirely into the Democratic Party, which became the Democratic Alliance we know today.\n\nThe Freedom Front Plus picked up a few other microparties and rebranded as the [Freedom Front Plus (FF+)](https://theconversation.com/the-who-why-and-what-of-south-africas-minority-afrikaner-party-116913). Just as the National Party and Democratic Alliance included many Coloured voters, the Freedom Front Plus was also able to pick up a few prominent Coloured political leaders. They presented themselves as a party not merely for Afrikaners, but for 'minorities' in general. In practise, they would maintain a keen focus on Afrikaners in particular, with a link to the Coloured community through the Afrikaans language, of which Coloureds comprise the majority of speakers.\n\n# Afriforum and Solidarity\n\nThe Afrikaner Nationalists were unsuccessful in negotiating a Volkstaat for themselves. When the National Party collapsed in the early 2000s, most of those voters ended up in the DA rather than the FF+. The transition to democracy had gone well, and the economy was growing. Mandela's project was successful, and the ANC commanded supermajorities in Parliament which they exercised mostly responsibly. The appetite for Volkstaat 80s/90s panic was thus quite low, and Afrikaners began to lose interest in even moderate forms of these ideas. Politically, the Freedom Front Plus was very weak, even just within White and Coloured communities.\n\nThese conditions meant that the Afrikaner Nationalists had to modernize in order to maintain their relevance. In 2006, Afriforum was founded. Here is how it is described on its website:\n\n&gt;AfriForum is a non-profit civil rights organisation that was established on 26 March 2006. The organisation was created to call up Afrikaners to participate in public debate and actions outside of the sphere of party politics\n\nAfriforum worked together with a White trade union, Solidarity, to form the broader Solidarity Movement to mobilize Afrikaners outside of party politics. One of the founders of Afriforum, Kallie Kriel, is a [former member of the Conservative Party](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/9-things-you-most-likely-didnt-know-about-afriforum_uk_5c7e96cde4b078abc6c1199f) and [the Freedom Front Plus](https://theconversation.com/south-africas-white-right-the-alt-right-and-the-alternative-103544). It is that same political tradition brought into a much more modern form.\n\nAfriforum is a very effective organization. It is not just a think tank, like the Heritage Foundation. Afriforum, together with the broader Solidarity movement, are active in undertaking practical projects and litigation to fix problems in failing communities. Here are some examples:\n\n* They have established a network of community policing forums. These are [neighbourhood and farm watch groups](https://www.biznews.com/sa-investing/2022/07/13/afriforum-state-proof-communities#:~:text=organisation%20has%20155%20neighbourhood%20and,continued%20failure%20of%20the%20government) staffed by thousands of volunteers and working [in coordination with the South African Police Service](https://www.politicsweb.co.za/politics/afriforum-and-saps-join-forces-to-combat-crime).\n* They fixed [potholes](https://www.citizen.co.za/rekord/news-headlines/2020/08/04/afriforum-volunteers-tackle-centurion-pothole/#:~:text=ImageAFriForum’s%20volunteers%20busy%20fixing%20the,Photo%3A%20Facebook) in the City of Pretoria and other municipalities, and organizing volunteers to assist local municipalities with basic services like [grass-cutting](https://www.iol.co.za/pretoria-news/news/city-join-hands-with-afriforum-to-render-services-a892eae4-da5d-4cda-bbc5-b53267f89e84).\n* They have taken the government to court to interdict decisions that they view as reckless or irresponsible, for example [donating money to Cuba](https://mg.co.za/news/2022-03-23-court-rules-in-favour-of-afriforum-to-halt-r50m-donation-to-cuba/) or [increasing electricity tariffs](https://www.news24.com/fin24/economy/afriforum-moves-to-bar-july-municipal-electricity-hikes-on-concerns-they-fall-short-of-law-20240609).\n* They have also taken educational institutions [to court](https://www.iol.co.za/pretoria-news/news/mixed-reaction-to-judgment-reinstating-afrikaans-as-learning-teaching-medium-at-unisa-0dcea307-ff9a-4172-953b-b23067dbad9a#:~:text=The%20apex%20court%2C%20in%20its,erroneous%20and%20inconsistent%20with%20history) when they choose to phase out Afrikaans-medium instruction in favour of an English-only model.\n* They[ built an Afrikaans-medium private technical college](https://www.citizen.co.za/news/south-africa/education/sol-tech-college-june-2023/) from scratch in the city of Centurion, near Pretoria, on time and under budget to fight against the growing tide of English-medium only education, and they are currently planning to build a [university](https://businesstech.co.za/news/lifestyle/785241/new-r3-billion-private-university-for-south-africa/).\n* Establishing a [private prosecutions unit](https://theconversation.com/explainer-how-south-africas-first-private-prosecutions-unit-will-work-72389) (I believe it is the first in the country) to take on cases that the state prosecutors wrongly ignore. The Afriforum Private Prosecutions unit is headed up by Gerrie Nel, the renowned prosecutor who put Oscar Pistorious behind bars.\n* They established a large media network called [Maroela Media](https://maroelamedia.co.za) which is one of the largest Afrikaans-language media organizations in the country.\n\nThis competence has built Afriforum some credibility amongst Afrikaners and the broader society.\n\nThey couple this with a communication network led by effective, younger communicators on digital platforms. For example, their head of Public Relations, Ernst van Zyl, has a YouTube channel under the name [the Conscious Caracal](https://www.youtube.com/@ConsciousCaracal) and publishes at [the Daily Friend](https://dailyfriend.co.za).\n\nSo the idea here is that Afriforum is not a political party. It's not about getting votes and cushy jobs and prestige. They are practical people just trying to build a better world. And they aren't just complaining. They're rolling up their sleeves and actually doing something. If you are even slightly right of center, then Afriforum's politics is the kind of politics that you probably find legitimate and respectable. Within the logic of right-wing politics - even moderate right-wing politics - Afriforum has earned the right to talk about concepts like self-determination through their competence and their exercise of [self-reliance](https://www.biznews.com/rational-perspective/2023/10/20/helpmekaar-movement-afrikaners-self-empowerment-ernst-van-zyl) and responsibility.\n\nAfriforum have taken off in Afrikaner communities. Their membership exceeds that which you might expect if it were one-to-one with Freedom Front Plus voters. It is their competent, practical projects and their non-partisan engagement that allows them to quietly build an authentic relationship within communities. It is also obvious that their political influence doesn't stop at the Freedom Front Plus but extends deep into the Democratic Alliance as a result of Afriforum's influence amongst the base.\n\nThese are the people that traveled to the US and begun to bring up Afrikaner issues as a salient topic in Trump world. And before we get to criticizing them, it is crucial to understand how they present positively: as practical, 'roll-up-your-sleeves' types who are smart, hard working and brave. Even if you are only slightly right of center, Afriforum, or at least the version of themselves they present, are impressive and seem legit.\n\n# Lobbying in the West\n\nAfriforum began a campaign of lobbying in the United States and the West in May 2018. Afriforum sent their CEO, Kallie Kriel, and Deputy CEO, Dr. Ersnt Roets, to the United States. According to [Tyler McBrien of the Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/blog/us-and-foreign-governments-should-be-skeptical-afriforums-lobbying):\n\n* They visited the CATO Institute, where they left one analyst convinced that the \"explicitly racist\" policies of the ANC government mirrored those under Apartheid\n* They persuaded Australia's home affairs minister to call for visas to be issued for farmers\n* Were featured on Tucker Carlson regarding farm murders\n\nThey also met [the Heritage Foundation](https://x.com/ErnstRoets/status/993591741231124486), [Ted Cruz and John Bolton](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/14/trump-musk-south-africa-afriforum).\n\nLater that year, President Donald Trump issued his first tweet about South Africa:\n\n&gt;I have asked Secretary of State [u/SecPompeo](https://twitter.com/SecPompeo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1032454567152246785%7Ctwgr%5E8f584b29218701fa76116c8906417c304d3bc8cf%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.news24.com%2Fnews24%2Four-lobbying-has-certainly-had-an-impact-afriforum-on-trumps-land-expropriation-comments-20180823) to closely study the South Africa land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers. “South African Government is now seizing land from white farmers.” [@TuckerCarlson](https://twitter.com/TuckerCarlson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1032454567152246785%7Ctwgr%5E8f584b29218701fa76116c8906417c304d3bc8cf%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.news24.com%2Fnews24%2Four-lobbying-has-certainly-had-an-impact-afriforum-on-trumps-land-expropriation-comments-20180823) [@FoxNews](https://twitter.com/FoxNews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1032454567152246785%7Ctwgr%5E8f584b29218701fa76116c8906417c304d3bc8cf%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.news24.com%2Fnews24%2Four-lobbying-has-certainly-had-an-impact-afriforum-on-trumps-land-expropriation-comments-20180823)\n\nHe cited Tucker Carlson in the tweet and Afriforum [took credit for it](https://www.news24.com/news24/our-lobbying-has-certainly-had-an-impact-afriforum-on-trumps-land-expropriation-comments-20180823):\n\n&gt;\"We welcome it,\" said Ernst Roets. The group travelled to the US in May to lobby individual members of the US Senate and the House of Representatives. \"I think our lobbying has certainly had an impact because we have spoken with a lot of people who have had contact with President Trump and we have spoken with many think tanks, one of them for example the Cato Institute, which has taken a very strong stance shortly before this statement now by President Trump.\"\n\nThis is how we know that it is Afriforum that is in Trump's ear, indirectly. Trump's interest in this issue predates Elon's involvement in the administration by years. I'm not saying Elon isn't contributing anything today. But the Afriforum-Carlson-Trump pipeline was clear from as early as 2018.\n\nAfriforum's lobbying wasn't limited to the United States. They also travelled to Australia. After their lobbying there, the Australian Home Affairs minister indicated that he wanted to look at providing some sort of [refugee intake for Afrikaners](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/peter-dutton-wants-a-refugee-intake-of-white-south-african-farmers-20180315-p4z4gr.html):\n\n&gt;\"I've asked the department to look at ways that we can provide some assistance. We could provide more visas for people potentially in the humanitarian program,\" Mr Dutton told 2GB radio on Thursday.\n\n&gt;\"If people are being persecuted, regardless of whether it's because of religion or the colour of their skin or whatever, we need to provide assistance where we can.\"\n\n&gt;Mr Dutton said there were already large numbers of South African expatriates living in Australia.\n\n&gt;\"They work hard, they integrate well into Australian society, they contribute to make us a better country and they're the sorts of migrants that we want to bring into our country,\" he said.\n\n&gt;On Wednesday, Mr Dutton told News Corp white South African farmers \"deserve special attention\" and \"need help from a civilised country like ours\", and the Home Affairs department was working with partners in the region, with an announcement likely to be forthcoming soon.\n\nIn 2024, Afriforum returned to the United States. Their leaders attended the National Conservative Conference ([NATCON4](https://solidaritymovement.co.za/afrikaner-foundation-afriforum-raise-support-in-usa/)). Dr. Roets gave a presentation about the [The Afrikaner Philosophy of Fixing Your Own Problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtGCOAxdakE). It's actually a really nice speech rhetorically, and again it speaks to that spirit of 'do it for yourself' which Afriforum can genuinely lay some claim to. Roets is quite smart and well read. He is educated in law and his arguments have depth and logic to them.\n\nHe and other voices in this world have a very clever and fascinating proposition which they like to put forward to Westerners: that Zimbabwe's past is South Africa's ongoing present is the future of the West. Roets didn't use the word DEI in this speech (from late 2024), but that's the key idea here: that a powerful + DEI will lead to other people coming in and using that state against you, and you are better off doing things at a small-scale, self-reliant community level. The history and experiences of the Afrikaners become a case study in the effects of progressive politics. I strongly encourage you to watch or listen to the speech.\n\nUnfortunately, Roets often makes misleading claims and, more frequently, misleads audiences through omission. Westerners generally don't have enough of a background in the minutiae of South African history to poke holes in some of the arguments he makes. For example, in the speech he delivered at NATCON4, he contrasts the early 20th century Afrikaners who believed in self-help with those of the second half of the 20th century who believed in Big Government. He omits that it was the early 20th century Afrikaners who undertook a massive mineworkers strike and advocated for the government to maintain a [Colour Bar that would prevent willing and able Black people from undertaking skilled work in the mines](https://www.apartheidmuseum.org/uploads/files/Resources/learners-Book/Learners-book-Chapter2.pdf). \n\n# Mask Off\n\nBy all accounts, Afriforum's lobbying in the U.S. has been very successful. Donald Trump issued an executive order prioritising refugee settlement for Afrikaners as a direct consequence of their lobbying, and U.S. Congressmen have double down on this. \n\nBut, believe it or not, Afriforum isn't really happy with this. Because they don't want refugee status to escape South Africa, what they want is what the Afrikaner Nationalists have wanted since the transition to democracy - an ethnostate/enclave. There are many different and innovative ways to spin it, but that's basically the goal here. That is the reason why these organizations did not declare victory when Trump offered them refugee status, but instead submitted a memorandum [requesting](https://afriforum.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Washington-memorandum-25-Feb-2025-3.pdf) that\n\n&gt;Aid be provided to an Afrikaner development fund to assist with community infrastructure protecting Afrikaners. This includes safety structures, social structures, job structures, training structures and infrastructure to settle Afrikaners in a concentrated manner\n\nIt's the Volkstaat again, folks.\n\nIn addition to having a questionable end goal, every now and then, representatives from these movements will go mask off and draw immense criticism as a result. Even if you limit yourself to criticism only from centrist and right wing White people, you are left with:\n\n* Frans Cronje of the IRR think tank accusing them of releasing a documentary that attempted to [sanitize Apartheid and telling them to apologize](https://www.news24.com/News24/verwoerd-documentary-must-retracted-urges-irr-afriforum-says-neewat-20190313)\n* Gareth van Onselen, a prominent and fairly harsh liberal commentator, calling the same documentary [disgraceful](https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/opinion/columnists/2019-03-13-gareth-van-onselen-afriforums-disgraceful-and-immoral-documentary/) for its portrayal of Hendrik Verwoerd, the architect of Apartheid\n* Various academics circulating a letter of condemnation after Roets, in response to being fact-checked by an academic, quoted a Jewish writer Victor Klemperer, who wrote that if the tables were turned after the Holocaust he \"[would have all the intellectuals strung up](https://web.archive.org/web/20210308203417/https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2018/05/06/afriforum-heavyweight-launches-attack-on-academic-over-criticism-about-us-tour_a_23428355/?ncid=other_saredirect_m2afnz7mbfm), and the professors three feet higher than the rest; they would be left hanging from the lamp posts for as long as was compatible with hygiene.\"\n* Broad condemnation for Kallie Kriel, Afriforum's leader, for saying that [Apartheid was not a crime against humanity](https://mg.co.za/article/2018-05-14-i-dont-think-apartheid-was-a-crime-against-humanity-afriforums-kallie-kriel/) but it was wrong.\n* Constitutional Court Justice Edwin Cameron who raged in a judgment about Afriforum describing Apartheid as a '[so-called historical injustice](https://www.news24.com/News24/afriforum-hijacking-the-afrikaner-mainstream-20160726)'\n* [White MPs](https://www.news24.com/news24/racist-kids-from-pretoria-afriforum-slammed-for-tirade-about-land-20180906) from the ANC, DA and ACDP for their presentation on land expropriation. The ANC MP, who formerly was a member of the National Party, equated them to one of the most extreme Black Radical groups in South Africa, BLF. The DA MP said she found that she could not align with them at all. And the ACDP MP said that Afriforum were taking us backwards. [Video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsRipnvxkqQ).\n* Max du Preez describing Afriforum's youth wing as \"[stormtroopers](https://www.news24.com/News24/afriforum-hijacking-the-afrikaner-mainstream-20160726)\" and compared the mentality of Afriforum's supporters [to the EFF](https://web.archive.org/web/20190707134613/https://www.news24.com/Columnists/MaxduPreez/the-problem-afriforum-is-causing-the-da-20180515) on the other side of the aisle. I am not an Afrikaner and am not in all the Whatsapp groups and I don't go to community events. But du Preez says that in many circles pro-Afriforum are vicious and rabid in their defense of the organization, and they behave as cruel bullies.\n\nTwo things can be true at once. It is true that Afriforum are effective, capable and intelligent people who have built one of South Africa's most impactful NGOs/civil society organizations. It is also true that, the minute you scratch just a little bit deeper, you find Apartheid apologia, racism, authoritarianism, bullying and Christian nationalism.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWe know who is influencing the Republican Party on Afrikaners - it's Afriforum and their sister organizations collectively known as the Solidarity Movement. These organizations ultimately trace their heritage back to the Conservative Party - the party formed to resist even the modest 'reforms' to Apartheid in the 80s. \n\nThese organizations are full of persuasive, competent and intelligent people. They are also built on horrible historical foundations, starting from the mission to preserve the Apartheid system even after the National Party had begun to give up on it. The content that they put out, and the conduct of their members, has led to some prominent and respected voices in White South African politics labelling these organizations as racist hateful bullies when they feel they have an opportunity to do so without being punished by their peers or through litigation.\n\nThese organizations have successfully modernized Afrikaner Nationalism for the digital, 21st century era. They have managed to sync up with right wing movements and media ecosystems across the Western world, and to portray a story of Afrikaner history which resonates deeply with the agenda and worldview of the global Western right - from America to Germany to Australia. The story that Afriforum tell about themselves is misleading, and the stories they tell about South Africa are effectively Apartheid denialism. But these stories are growing in reach as the West continues to embrace ethnonationalist right wing ideas.\n\nThe success of the Solidarity Movement have prompted other right wing White voices to also journey to the US. [The Cape Independence Advocacy Group](https://www.primediaplus.com/2025/03/20/cape-independence-advocacy-group-to-lobby-us-for-western-cape-secession) has announced they will be going to the US, as have representatives from the Afrikaner-enclave town known as [Orania](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/south-africas-white-afrikaner-separatists-want-trumps-help-become-state-2025-04-03/).

This then gradually flows upstream until it reaches the ears of Trump, who is either personally racist or knows that his voters are, and is therefore incentivized to champion this cause.

These days they talk about designating certain parts of the country to fall under specific community councils and devolving a lot of government power down to those councils, with protections for local / relative minorities. That plus Cape Independence, which gets you some nice urban areas and a big city.\n\nFrom the FF Plus 2024 Manifesto section on Self Determination:\n\n&gt; The FF Plus sees diversity as an asset for South Africa. So, diversity ought to be recognised and cherished on all levels of government. This includes respect for all communities’ languages, symbols, historical names and heritage.\n\n&gt; We urgently need a new political dispensation that truly recognises South Africa’s diversity; such recognition is a vital building block for achieving true unity in diversity. A dispensation built on mutual respect, without discrimination and racism, with access to equal opportunities, which recognises everyone’s individual as well as shared identity. Thus, a system whereby the correct forms of self-determination are implemented. Sections 235, 30, 31 and 185 of the Constitution and the Self-Determination Agreement are key, and the FF Plus is fully committed to it.\n\n&gt; This approach is a modern and practical political approach. Federalism, the devolution of power, subsidiarity, affording geographical building blocks more power, autonomy for areas and provinces, greater freedom for the Cape, a do-it-yourself approach, and a smaller government are all possible alternatives and crucial building blocks for such a political model.\n\n&gt; It is important to note that none of these possibilities is the only exclusive solution. This is not a situation where either this or that can be the only solution. Due to our diversity and the different circumstances in the various parts of South Africa, we find ourselves in a situation that requires this and that solution as well as a further variation of solutions.\n\n&gt; That is why the FF Plus supports the various initiatives promoting these solutions, including CapeXit. It is important that registered voters in the Western Cape are afforded the opportunity to express their views on the path of self-determination that they wish to take to greater independence and decision-making about their future, which could ultimately lead to autonomy and possible independence.\n\n&gt; The FF Plus, furthermore, endeavours to secure autonomy for a cultural community across the country, particularly concerning matters such as education, elderly care, sport, heritage conservation and the like.\n\n&gt; Community councils, such as an Afrikaner Council, should be established for communities that are spread out across the country.\n\n&gt; Such a council must have control of the relevant community’s education, heritage conservation and social care. Worldwide, these are considered the most basic ways in which national minorities can exercise self-determination.\n\n&gt; In practice, it would mean that the governing bodies of all schools, social institutions (for example, old-age homes and children’s homes) and heritage institutions (for example, museums and heritage sites) can decide whether or not they want to fall under the authority of the government or the community council.\n\n&gt; This is not racial segregation. A traditional Afrikaner school may not be interested in falling under the administration of the Afrikaner Council, but a coloured school might. Everyone has the right to choose.\n\n&gt; Such a council will enable Afrikaners to exercise their cultural rights regardless of where they reside.\n\n&gt; In this way, a republican government can be established over time in the face of the current tyranny of the majority.\n\n&gt; A legal framework should be devised for purpose-founded communities.

They do usually get found guilty of hate speech, but the powerful ones have only ever received a slap on the wrist. It can feel like there is a double standard on hate speech and racism.

Whether you agree with those grievances or not, it is very clearly a \"White\" issue. But they took the White issues and ran with them as if it is targeted at them. They go out of their way in published documents and in Trump's executive order to emphasize Afrikaners as an \"ethnic minority\", which they are not. They are a part of a racial minority. Honestly the way they play with race and ethnic identity is so shady.\n\nThe US under Trump should stay out of our business entirely.

I don't think we should qualift for refugee status, and certainly not literally only one ethnic group only.\n\nFarm murders and attacks are coming down. And many of the victims of that stuff are people of colour who work on those farms.\n\nSo i just don't think it's warranted, and the stories seem to get inflated and generalised by people with no sense of scale or geography. It sounds like people overseas think that Whites across the country are being hunted for their skin colour by roving gangs. That's just not true. White people are fine, to the extent that anyone in South Africa is fine.\n\nWe just need to get our shit together on policing and grow the economy.",

        "selftext": "Most people dream of winning the lottery, or finding fame. I, however… dream of waking up to this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u9qmarfg2dp21.png?width=2316&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bda736774e4d52acef8a0e80cc62750278c44370\n\n**Incoming Transmission\\***\n\nWith the overwhelming success of Geonosis, we are proud to announce our next two maps coming to Battlefront II: Mygeeto and Cato Neimoidia, inspired by their appearances in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tdrd4ypn2dp21.png?width=2316&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a27a784a42805c35e28d7ac4f8eb3516da9e60d2\n\nMygeeto will be added to Battlefront II this July and will be playable in Galactic assault, Capital Supremacy, Extraction, strike, and Blast. It will feature two new playable vehicles, a new artillery unit, and four new default-planet skins: the 21st Nova Corps. Although you probably know them by their more common name, the Galactic Marines.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yd8n4v4t2dp21.png?width=2244&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49df3ed7f5bf2e3289974f0c362a6d1f5267843b\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uy10dpiw2dp21.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75922954fda91dd578cec4234879d13b3dac179a\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-MHelPqkag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-MHelPqkag)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a4drdwiy2dp21.png?width=325&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd836a6502aa9482da65932561e53aa68868d35d\n\n***MAGNA TRI-DROIDS***\n\nThe first phase focuses on fast paced, close quarters combat as the Clones escort their UT-AT through the city ruins while the Droids attempt to destroy it with rocket launchers. Rubble plays a key part in gameplay as in some cases it is your only cover from enemy fire.\n\nAs the UT-AT gets closer to the main building, the Clones will have to cross a bridge riddled with potholes and covered in debris. Although the bridge is completely exposed, the environment evolves as the battle progresses making the trip across the bridge much safer for the Clones.\n\nMore information on that later in the Transmission.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c54wbee03dp21.png?width=338&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=816a5979888907a2672779ee80f441e41229cb1c\n\n***THE MAIN BUILDING***\n\nThe UT-AT has reached the main building and destroyed both of the Magna tri-droids guarding the entrance. The Clones must now slice through the door’s security systems in order to gain entry. While they are doing this, the Droids will attack them from both flanks. The destroyed pieces of the Magna tri-droids are the Clones major sources of cover, although there is a network of tunnels below the city streets that can be used by the Droids and Clones to travel from opposing sides of the battlefield.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/umvbur533dp21.png?width=382&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1ffbdbeb23b071621b409f5dde2adf3803bb845\n\n***DROID POWER GENERATOR***\n\nNow inside the lobby of the main building the Clones must destroy the Droid’s main power generator to help thin out their numbers, thus making it easier for the Clones to take the building. This objective must be fired upon until it is destroyed. However, due to the multi-floor layout of the lobby Droid snipers will be a significant threat.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6665heb43dp21.png?width=359&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e516ebdb1de2b2c195d4dd9a51ee8d1f15a991b0\n\n***THE ELEVATOR***\n\nWith the Droid numbers falling rapidly, the Clones will now attempt to take the main elevator at the back of the building. In order to accomplish this, the Clones must slice through the elevator controls in the security room at the back, left of the building, and capture the elevator room before their reinforcements run out.\n\nThat’s not all, though. Two new fully player controlled vehicles, and one artillery unit will be added when Mygeeto launches.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5mp28heb3dp21.png?width=2493&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c85f1942039ab13a3471ab3bedbcdad03f41bf3\n\nTowering over enemy combatants, the Magna Tri-droid acts as devastating artillery support for the Separatists. Armed with three heavy laser cannons, three rocket launchers, and the ability to call in an air-strike, this behemoth is a force to be reckoned with.\n\nAlthough it will be stationary and placed reasonably far away from combat, it’s ability to zoom in, as well as it’s quick-moving projectiles, more than make up for this.\n\nAt a cost of 500 BP, this unit acts like the MTT, AT-AT, and LAAT in the sense that you must get eliminations with it to extend the amount of time you have in it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r7zati6e3dp21.png?width=2493&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d329c5c199387fc7dbd13265a53db4de3cc7a7ae\n\n*Processing img q3eq6gif3dp21...*\n\nSkitter your way through the back alleys of Um’eh city and ambush Clones and Jedi alike as the Combat Tri-droid, the spider-like tank used by the Confederacy of Independent Systems. This nightmarish droid / walker hybrid will cost 900 BP, and have 650 health.\n\nDespite being tiny in comparison to it’s larger counterpart, the Combat Tri-droid leaves nothing to be desired in weapons and abilities. Armed with three rapid-fire laser cannons, a scan-pulse ability, an automatic repair ability, and an ability to launch three anti-infantry rockets this droid packs quite a punch.\n\n*Processing img o6ljavdi3dp21...*\n\nFurthermore, due to it’s agile nature this vehicle will be the first walker in the game capable of both crouching, and evading like a regular trooper (albeit somewhat slower). To counter this, a fan favourite from the original Battlefront II will be returning: the TX-130 Saber tank. More details will be shared in another Transmission closer to release.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ae24jq7k3dp21.png?width=2493&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aaa9f71145ac1e93299e8579cfc323fb0e39f0f1\n\nAs the Clones approach the bridge connecting the city and the main building, a ferocious blizzard blows throughout the city, rendering many homing weapons useless and nearly blinding the troopers on the battlefront. Like the sandstorm on Geonosis, the effects of the blizzard become greater over distance, making attempts at sniping the Clones on the bridge futile.\n\nThe reduced visibility also plays in favour of fast moving units like the Combat Tri-droid, the B-X Droid commando, and the BARC speeder, as they can now rush towards players head on; but only become visible once it’s too late.\n\nThe blizzard will continue to blow throughout phase 2, and can be seen outside the main building’s windows during phase 3 and 4.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t85dsz7n3dp21.png?width=2493&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5020077d111d8a3e4893ae979dac4de7aed803f5\n\nNew weapons and star cards have arguably been the most requested addition to Battlefront II aside from maps since launch, and we are happy to say that with the release of Mygeeto we will also be releasing 4 brand new weapons, as well as various star cards for the Assault, Heavy, Officer, and Specialist classes. The cards we are adding vary from a placable medical droid for the officer, to a devastating alternative to the Heavy’s Z-6 rotary cannon, the Reciprocating quad blaster.\n\nThe new weapons will get their own Community transmission closer to the end of the month, but in the meantime here is a brief description of what is coming.\n\nASSAULT\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the Assault, we are adding the DP-23. It is a shotgun with a low rate of fire intended for mid-range combat. Although it is devastating at the right distance, firing at an enemy that is too close will deal less damage. It also suffers from high recoil.\n\nHEAVY\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe heavy will be getting the DC-17. Although visually somewhat similar to the TL-50, the DC-17 has a lower rate of fire. This is made up for with an increased damage per bolt, and reduced spread.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOFFICER\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe officer’s new weapon will be the DC-15s side arm. It’s main strength is it’s cooling capabilities, which allow it to fire uninterrupted for a longer period of time than any other blaster currently in the game. If it overheats, however, it has an incredibly long cool down time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSPECIALIST\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nActing as a compromise between the NT-242 and the IQA-11, the DC-15x does more damage than the IQA-11, but with a slower rate of fire and slightly slower bolt speed. To help with darker environments, it has an unlockable night vision scope.\n\nNow then, it’s time to address another highly requested feature since the launch of the game while also satisfying our Original Trilogy fans.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/43qz2td14dp21.png?width=2493&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a79982d95dea016882bcb01bf47d2f7af4cd777\n\nMygeeto will be the first map in Star Wars Battlefront II to feature a Prequel Trilogy scenario, AND an Original Trilogy scenario. The Prequel scenario is covered fairly in depth in this Transmission, and the Original Trilogy scenario will receive it’s own Transmission closer to release.\n\nIn the meantime however, we can tell you that it’s based on the battle mentioned in the original novel “Battlefront: Twilight Company”. It will feature a brand new objective, new planet default skins for the Rebel Alliance (the sixty first mobile infantry), as well as additional parts of the map that are unreachable in the Prequel Trilogy version.\n\nFinally, as a teaser for what’s to come after Mygeeto has been released, players will travel to the misty world of Cato Neimoidia and fly throughout the shrouded cities as the Republic and CIS battle for ariel superiority….\n\n*Punch it.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n============================================================\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*This “Community Transmission” is simply a fan concept, and is in no way official or tied to DICE, Electronic Arts, or the Walt Disney Company.\n\nCredits:\n\nI (MajesticAndHolyWade) am responsible for the following:\n\nWriting the CT, re-creating the CT's artwork, character / prop rigging, character animation, camera animation, pre-visualization, layout, lighting, dynamic and procedural effects, compositing, audio-layout as well as minor sound effect creation, writing and digitally performing the original score, and modelling / texturing, with the exception of the following:\n\nVehicles: LAAT, BARC speeder, Hyena Bomber and AT-ST\n\nCharacters: B1 Battledroid, Clone trooper, Snow trooper, Snow rebel, and Iden Versio\n\nWeapons / misc: DC-15s, DC-15a, DC-17, Valken-38x, E-11, A280, TL-50, various pieces of scrap metal\n\nThese were modelled and textured by DICE. The galactic marine contains some of my own modelling (mask, pauldrons, backpack, and knee guards) as well as being completely retextured by me. The Clone tank driver's helmet shell was modelled and textured by me, and the body used a modified Clone trooper texture.\n\nThe spawn screen overlay and release date screens were created by DICE (and modified by me, to fit this project).\n\nAside from the music, I don't own anything in this project (as far as copyright is concerned).\n\nVoice acting was done by a friend of mine, Matt.\n\nA small behind the scenes video is in the works, but there is no ETA for it yet. /u/F8RGE, /u/EA_Charlemagne, I know DICE isn't supposed to use community ideas in the final game (although, if there's some weird IP law I'm unaware of, I'm happy to surrender whatever rights I have to this to DICE), so how about you look at this as a MASSIVE amount of fan art instead? (I'll give 'ya both a ride on the UT-AT if you actually do it, though)\n\nNow, there's one thing I want to say: I'm a prequel fan, no doubt about it, but I recognize we've had a pretty good run as of late, so I think it's completely fair if we get Scarif, or some other OT content first.\n\nThanks,",

        "selftext": "This post is a follow-up to u/Fly-Bottle's post titled [Libertarians, how do you feel about the fact that your ideology is essentially funded by billionaires?](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1jaay8f/libertarians_how_do_you_feel_about_the_fact_that/) I wrote a bit about this in another comment but I feel it deserves its own post because it's such a broad topic and really deserves more attention.\n\n# And to be clear (please read before continuing)\n\nI'm not saying that any of this funding ultimately discredits libertarianism or any of its principles nor is this post meant to be an attack on the libertarian movement or individual libertarians. The point of this is not to point fingers and say \"You're wrong because you're funded by bad guys!\"\n\nI'm in big part intending for this post to be a friendly warning to libertarians that many of the groups they follow are being funded by these industries and that this funding [sways their overall message](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funding_bias), that is after all why these groups dump such large funds into them, and they may be impacting your views in ways you would otherwise not realize.\n\nI am also aware not all of these are strictly \"libertarian\" but rather part of the broader conservative/liberty movement, but they're all groups I see people reference or cite articles from as evidence for their policies or proposed ideas so I think they're worth noting.\n\n# So who funds the libertarian movement?\n\nThis list is by NO MEANS definitive. If I were to write one it'd probably take weeks.\n\n[**The Cash for Comments Economist's Network**](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Cash_for_Comments_Economists_Network) is a disinformation network run by tobacco company lobbyists and employees whose primary purpose is to downplay the negative health effects of smoking by writing op-eds pushing their narrative, funding research that comes to conclusions favorable to the tobacco industry, and smearing anti-smoking campaigns.\n\nThey or their key members have funded or contributed significantly to:\n\n* The Mises Institute, several key personnel there are also members of CCEN ([Source](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Ludwig_von_Mises_Institute#Personnel))\n* The Cato Institute ([Source](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Cash_for_Comments_Economists_Network#Network_Establishment))\n* The Atlas Group ([Source](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Cash_for_Comments_Economists_Network#Network_Establishment))\n* The Center for Public Choice ([Source](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Cash_for_Comments_Economists_Network#Network_Establishment))\n* The Institute of Economic Affairs ([Source](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Cash_for_Comments_Economists_Network#Network_Establishment))\n* The American Enterprise Institute ([Source](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Cash_for_Comments_Economists_Network#Network_Establishment))\n* The Heritage Foundation ([Source](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Cash_for_Comments_Economists_Network#Network_Establishment))\n* The Reason Foundation ([Source](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Cash_for_Comments_Economists_Network#Network_Establishment))\n\n[**The Koch Brothers**](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Koch_Brothers), you know them already, they're responsible for a significant amount of disinformation regarding climate change, tobacco's health impact, unions, and many many other topics. They have also successfully influenced public policy and the Republican Party platform on multiple occasions. Most of their activities happen through orgs they own such as [Americans for Prosperity](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Americans_for_Prosperity#Tobacco) and [Stand Together (aka Stand Together Chamber of Commerce)](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Stand_Together_Chamber_of_Commerce). They've been funding various right-wing groups for four decades, with the most recent efforts being aimed at creating the illusion of there being some sort of controversy or debate over whether or not the current global warming trend is caused by humans burning fossil fuels.\n\nThey or their key members have funded or contributed significantly to:\n\n* Young Americans for Liberty ([Source](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Stand_Together_Chamber_of_Commerce#Grant_Recipients))\n* Americans for Limited Government ([Source](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Stand_Together_Chamber_of_Commerce#Grant_Recipients))\n* The Cato Institute ([Source](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/23/koch-brothers-agenda-key-donations-promotions))\n* The Reason Foundation ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_network#Think_tanks_and_political_organizations))\n* The Manhattan Institute ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_family))\n* Many universities, most notably George Mason University which is famous for its libertarian influence ([Source](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2016-7-27-rightward-ho-ten-top-funders-behind-the-surging-libertarian-html))\n\nAnd many many many more... I could write all night about it. You get the picture.\n\n[**The Scaife Foundation Network**](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Richard_Mellon_Scaife) is three foundations: the Sarah Scaife Foundation, the Carthage Foundation, and the Allegheny Foundation - all owned by Richard Scaife, a billionaire oil and aluminum industrialist.

They're also extremely generous when it comes to donations to various right-wing groups and movements.\n\nThey or their key members have funded or contributed significantly to:\n\n* The Cato Institute ([Source](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Organisations_listed_in_the_Exxonsecrets_database))\n* The Heritage Foundation ([Source](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Organisations_listed_in_the_Exxonsecrets_database))\n* The Heartland Institute ([Source](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Organisations_listed_in_the_Exxonsecrets_database))\n* The Small Business Survival Committee ([Source](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Organisations_listed_in_the_Exxonsecrets_database))\n* The Reason Foundation ([Source](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Organisations_listed_in_the_Exxonsecrets_database))\n* The American Enterprise Institute ([Source](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Organisations_listed_in_the_Exxonsecrets_database))\n* The Hudson Institute ([Source](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Organisations_listed_in_the_Exxonsecrets_database))\n\n[**Phillip Morris company**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Morris_International), a parent company of Altria, is the company that produces Marlboro, L&amp;M, Chesterfield, and other cigarette brands. They're also infamous producers of disinformation and have been repeatedly found to have funded fraudulent research saying tobacco smoking isn't as dangerous as health officials claim. They've also paid conservative groups to smear tax reforms and legislation that is unfavorable to the tobacco industry.\n\nThey or their key members have funded or contributed significantly to:\n\n* The Cato Institute ([Source](https://www.tobaccotactics.org/article/Think-Tanks/#ttref-note-11))\n* The Atlas Network ([Source](https://www.tobaccotactics.org/article/Think-Tanks/#ttref-note-11))\n* The Mises Institute, via Atlas Network ([Source](https://www.desmog.com/atlas-economic-research-foundation/))\n* The Cato Institute ([Source](https://www.tobaccotactics.org/article/Think-Tanks/#ttref-note-11))\n* The Heritage Foundation ([Source](https://www.tobaccotactics.org/article/Think-Tanks/#ttref-note-11))\n* Students for Liberty ([Source](https://www.tobaccotactics.org/article/Think-Tanks/#ttref-note-11))\n* The American Enterprise Institute ([Source](https://www.tobaccotactics.org/article/Think-Tanks/#ttref-note-11))\n* The Freedom Foundation ([Source](https://www.tobaccotactics.org/article/Think-Tanks/#ttref-note-11))\n* FreedomWorks ([Source](https://www.tobaccotactics.org/article/Think-Tanks/#ttref-note-11))\n* The Reason Foundation ([Source](https://www.tobaccotactics.org/article/Think-Tanks/#ttref-note-11))\n\n# \"But this is just a conspiracy theory! So what if they gave them a few dollars once? They also donated to other non-think tank groups so why is it only bad when they donate to these?\"\n\nFor one, it wasn't a few bucks. You can see in the sources it was tens, sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars over the span of several years. Several of these think tanks and groups are getting funding from multiple different foundations within the same industry or that are run by the same billionaire families - many are receiving annual donations.\n\nSecond, the purpose of these donations is to sway their opinion and to get them to support causes they support. We know they're doing this on purpose from [leaked documents and evidence in court cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_industry_playbook) which outlined how they sowed disinformation and created the illusion of controversies surrounding topics there was already a scientific consensus on.\n\nIt isn't a coincidence that The Cato Institute takes funding from fossil fuel companies and then starts [campaigns challenging the scientific consensus on climate change](https://www.cato.org/commentary/political-assault-climate-skeptics) or the Heritage foundation publishes [articles making false claims that there is more evidence coming out showing climate change isn't a big deal](https://www.heritage.org/environment/commentary/different-perspective-global-warming), it isn't a coincidence that the Mises Institute takes funding from the tobacco industry and then shares articles about [why smokers are actually oppressed minorities](https://mises.org/mises-wire/tobacco-smokers-americas-most-persecuted-minority). These orgs are trying to appeal to their funders.\n\nAnd this has a real impact besides just articles posted online a few econ nerds may read. The Cato Institute [funds universities, has affected policy making, and its members have been called on as experts in the media](https://www.cato.org/support/impact-test), The Heritage Foundation is [currently influencing the Trump administration's policies](https://www.heritage.org/impact/trump-administration-embraces-heritage-foundation-policy-recommendations).\n\n# \"But this says nothing about the overall message! Just what they're saying about climate change and tobacco smoking!\"\n\nLike I said, this is a fraction of the billionaire and millionaire funding libertarian think tanks receive, and it isn't all from these industries - they just happen to be influential and noteworthy contributors. All these think tanks have spoken out against different policies not directly related to climate change or smoking because they were unfavorable to these industries, often citing libertarian principles as a reason.\n\nFor example Cato [published an article about why action against climate change was authoritarian and bad for the economy from a libertarian standpoint](https://www.cato.org/publications/climate-change-national-security-balancing-costs-benefits#benefits), The Mises Institute [argued against tobacco regulation by calling them authoritarian and drawing parallels between them and Nazism](https://mises.org/free-market/are-cigarettes-doomed), The Reason Foundation [conducted a dubious research concluding that policies regularly pushed by fossil fuel companies were the most beneficial way to combat climate change and emphasized the lower taxes and increased competition which reconciled with their libertarian views](https://reason.org/policy-study/evidence-based-policies-to-slow-climate-change/), Americans for Prosperity [successfully lobbied against American Clean Energy and Security Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Clean_Energy_and_Security_Act) which Cato and Heritage also argued against with dubious cost figures.",

In an ideal free market, where there is no government intervention, companies must compete and provide value to customers. Removing safety regulations and taxes would not mean that companies would start selling unsafe products or exploiting workers. On the contrary, competition and consumer choice would set the level of quality and fairness for companies.\n\nThe concept of “slave wages” only arises when the government intervenes and distorts the labor market. In a free market, where everything is voluntary, wages are determined by the supply and demand for labor. If a company were to exploit workers, it would face rapid competition that would offer better conditions.\n\nIn reality, the government often supports monopolies, allows for profiteering, and prevents real competition by creating barriers to new entrants. The solution is not more government, but less. A legitimate free market is one in which individuals are free to enter markets, trade, and create without artificial barriers.",

He started out as Rep. Devin Nunes’ aide, writing a memo that alleged FBI bias against Trump and attempted to discredit the investigation into Russian election interference. He was on Trump’s National Security Council, was reportedly part of Giuliani’s backchannel to Ukraine, and was later appointed to Defense Department Chief of Staff.\n\n* The same WaPo report also revealed that Patel botched a 2020 hostage rescue mission in Nigeria: “Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were angry that, in their view, Patel had prematurely said the operation was fully cleared...One senior Pentagon official said he was ‘incensed’ at Patel. A second senior Pentagon official described Patel’s actions as potentially ‘dangerous’ for the SEALs.”\n\n**A new report released by the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General revealed that Trump’s deployment of law enforcement to Portland, OR, last summer cost $12.3 million.** The IG notes ([PDF](https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2021-04/OIG-21-31-Mar21.pdf)) that the estimated damage caused to Hatfield Courthouse, which DHS and FPS were guarding, only cost $1.6 million. Additionally, few of the officers had been trained in riot and crowd control, even though that was their primary mission:\n\n&gt;The inspector general’s office [examined](https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2021/04/federal-agents-sent-to-portland-to-defend-courthouse-lacked-consistent-training-equipment-or-use-of-force-policies-report-says.html) one day, Aug. 7, and found that of 222 officers deployed to Portland, 36 didn’t appear on a training roster showing they had received a legal briefing on their authority or the criminal laws they could enforce on federal property. Fourteen of those 36 officers used less-lethal munitions against people in Portland, increasing the department’s liability, the report said… In a review of 63 officers, only seven had received riot or crowd control training, according to the inspector general’s office.\n\n**The same IG, Joseph Cuffari, blocked career officials’ plan to investigate the role of the Secret Service in clearing protestors from Lafayette Square last June.** Cuffari served as a policy advisor for Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey before being nominated and confirmed as DHS IG in 2019. The Lafayette incident was widely criticized as the protesters were peaceful and were violently cleared for Trump to stage a photo op. The Project on Government Oversight (POGO) [obtained](https://www.pogo.org/investigation/2021/04/pulling-punches-trump-appointed-watchdog-suppressed-white-house-related-probes/) documents that revealed Cuffari’s role:\n\n&gt;Cuffari’s decision to avoid delving into such sensitive issues in the run-up to a presidential election inevitably raises questions about his role as an independent and non-partisan watchdog overseeing one of the largest and most consequential Cabinet departments… Unlike most other Trump appointees, but typical for inspectors general, Cuffari remains in his role during the Biden administration.\n\nCuffari also blocked an investigation into the Secret Service’s coronavirus protocols - which appeared to be regularly disregarded. “At one point, more than 130 agents, or about 10% of the agency’s core security personnel, were ordered to isolate or quarantine after testing positive for COVID-19,” POGO states.\n\n**Recently acquired documents have provided evidence that the Trump administration used “covert surveillance” to monitor and “infiltrate” racial justice protests last summer.** Nonprofit watchdog CREW [obtained](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/emails-show-deas-covert-surveillance-of-racial-justice-protesters-in-philadelphia-chicago-albuquerque/) internal DOJ emails in which Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) officials assigned undercover agents to “identify protest leaders” within Philadelphia's protests and instructed those in the field to download a “communications app” to carry out their “surveillance operation”. Separately, The Intercept revealed [emails](https://theintercept.com/2021/04/22/drones-black-lives-matter-protests-marshals/) indicating that the U.S. Marshals Service flew unmanned drones over Washington, D.C., on June 5 and 7 to surveil Black Lives Matter rallies:\n\n&gt;[The email] states that a redacted entity “responded to Washington DC” and “conducted one flight,” the same day Mayor Muriel Browser asked Donald Trump to “withdraw all extraordinary law enforcement and military presence from Washington, DC.”  \n\n* Related: “D.C. Guard misused helicopters in low-flying confrontation with George Floyd protesters, Army concludes,” [WaPo](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/04/15/dc-guard-helicopter-george-floyd-protest/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=wp_main)\n\n* Related: “Police Say an Antifa Activist Likely Shot at Officers.

Inspector General concluded that Trump officials intentionally blocked $20 billion in hurricane relief to Puerto Rico.** IG Rae Oliver Davis [said](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/new-probe-confirms-trump-officials-blocked-puerto-rico-receiving-hurri-rcna749) the aid was “unnecessarily delayed by bureaucratic obstacles,” like a new and unexplained review requirement imposed by the Office of Management and Budget (led by Trump loyalist Mick Mulvaney, at the time). Davis also reported ([PDF](https://www.hudoig.gov/sites/default/files/2021-04/HUD%20OIG%20Final%20Report_2019SU008945I.pdf)) that the administration delayed and obstructed her investigation; top HUD officials - including Secretary Ben Carson - refused to be interviewed by investigators.\n\n---\n---\n\n##Corruption\n\n**Former Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao repeatedly used her position and agency staff to support her family’s shipping business, leading the Inspector General to refer the case to the DOJ for possible criminal investigation.** Chao, the wife of Senator Mitch McConnell, [involved](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/03/elaine-chao-dot-inspector-general-report-473536) family members in her planned official trip to China - where her family's shipping company, Foremost Group, does significant business (note: the trip was canceled after media attention led to criticism). She provided Transportation Dept. public affairs support to her father and used staff for personal tasks:\n\n&gt;A review of DOT emails and interviews with staff revealed that OST staffers provided various\nmedia and public affairs support to the Secretary’s father in 2017 and 2018. In addition to the\nplanned book signing in China, there were several additional instances where OST staff were\ndirected to help promote Dr. Chao’s biography, Fearless Against the Wind. ([PDF](https://www.oig.dot.gov/sites/default/files/DOT%20OIG%20Letter%20to%20Chairman%20Peter%20DeFazio_2021-03-02.pdf))\n\nThe IG referred the case to the DOJ on Dec. 16, 2020, for potential criminal charges. The Department - led by then-Attorney General Bill Barr - declined to take it up, saying “there may be ethical and/or administrative issues to address but there is not predication to open a criminal investigation.” \n\n* Reminder: The IG leading the investigation into Chao, Mitch Behm, was abruptly demoted by Trump in May 2020, leaving an acting official in the position. The day after the IG’s office referred the case to the DOJ for prosecution, McConnell brought Trump’s nominee for permanent IG to the floor for a vote. Days later, Eric Soskin was confirmed to the position (and is still there).\n\n---\n---\n\n##Pandemic-related investigations\n\n**House Democrats have opened an investigation into Emergent BioSolutions, the company that botched millions of Covid-19 vaccine doses, and its close relationship with a Trump official.** House Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney and Coronavirus panel Chair James Clyburn [sent](https://oversight.house.gov/news/press-releases/maloney-and-clyburn-launch-investigation-into-emergent-biosolutions-profits-and) a letter to the top executives last week seeking information on the $628 million federal contract Emergent was given in June 2020:\n\n&gt;“Specifically, we are investigating reports that Emergent received multi-million-dollar contracts to manufacture coronavirus vaccines despite a long, documented history of inadequately trained staff and quality control issues… Dr. Robert Kadlec, who served as Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response under President Trump and previously worked as a consultant for Emergent, appears to have pushed for this award despite indications that Emergent did not have the ability to reliably fulfill the contract.”\n\nClyburn called upon Emergent’s President and CEO, Robert Kramer, and Emergent’s Executive Chairman, Fuad El-Hibri, to testify at a hearing on May 19, 2021.\n\n*New information: CEO Kramer [sold](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/emergent-robert-kramer-stock-sales/2021/04/25/de151434-a2b6-11eb-a7ee-949c574a09ac_story.html) more than $10 million worth of his stock in the company in January and early February - just weeks before the stock price tumbled from $125/share to $62/share. In other words, he would have lost $5.5 million had he not sold before the plant’s failure was publicly disclosed.* \n\n* 15 million doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s coronavirus vaccine that were manufactured at Emergent’s plant were thrown out; no doses made there have gone to the public. The New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/21/us/politics/emergent-johnson-johnson-covid-vaccine.html) that problems at the plant were known during the Trump administration: “A series of confidential audits last year, obtained by The Times, warned about risks of viral and bacterial contamination and a lack of proper sanitation at the Baltimore plant.”\n\n* Whistleblower Rick Bright, former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, filed a complaint around the time of the Emergent award [warning](https://www.rollcall.com/2020/06/10/trump-health-officials-approach-to-contracts-faces-scrutiny/) that Kadlec and other officials were awarding lucrative contracts to former business acquaintances and friends, instead of focusing on projects with scientific merit.\n\n**Nearly a full year ago, the Trump administration awarded $1.3 billion to a company that promised to make vaccine syringes, yet none have been delivered to date.** The Defense Department and Health and Human Services first [contracted](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/trump-administration-awarded-firm-1-3-billion-make-covid-vaccine-n1263872) with ApiJect Systems in May 2020 to produce inexpensive prefilled plastic syringes; in November 2020, the company received a $590 million loan to build a “gigafactory” for the product that would create 650 jobs. So far, the syringes have not been FDA approved and the construction of the factory has not begun.\n\n* Contrary to the conservative “Made in America” nationalism, nearly [every step](https://www.cato.org/blog/covid-19-vaccines-depend-globalization-therefore-so-does-trump-administration) in researching, developing, manufacturing, and distributing the coronavirus vaccine has been a global effort. For instance, most of Pfizer’s vaccine production is done in Belgium, using supply chains that stretch from Egypt to China. The U.S. [imports](https://wits.worldbank.org/trade/comtrade/en/country/USA/year/2018/tradeflow/Imports/partner/ALL/nomen/h5/product/901831) syringes from China, Mexico, Germany, and Israel, among other countries. A [network](https://www.wsj.com/articles/from-freezer-farms-to-jets-logistics-operators-prepare-for-a-covid-19-vaccine-11598639012?reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter) of shipping companies from Lufthansa to DHL transports the vaccine doses across the globe.",

            "body": "Just to highlight this, because it increasingly appears that a federal agents and local law enforcement (Thurston County, WA) murdered a man (who was accused of shooting and killing a Trump supporter):\n\n&gt;While investigators found a spent bullet casing in the back seat of Mr. Reinoehl’s car, and pointed to that as evidence he probably fired his weapon, the handgun they recovered from Mr. Reinoehl had a full magazine, according to multiple photos compiled by Thurston County authorities showing Mr. Reinoehl’s handgun. The gun was found in his pocket.\n\n&gt;...But one of the witnesses that Thurston County investigators relied on to reach their conclusion that Mr. Reinoehl had fired his gun was an 8-year-old boy... Of the two other witnesses who investigators cited to support the conclusion that Mr. Reinoehl fired his gun, one did not see it happen and the other was not sure...\n\n&gt;Although he did not see a gun, Deputy Oleole said, he began firing his AR-15 rifle through his own windshield at Mr. Reinoehl. Officer Merrill, thinking the glass shards from the windshield meant he was under fire, exited the Ford Escape, saw what he believed was Mr. Reinoehl reaching for a gun, and also opened fire.\n\n&gt;...The final report also does not address the fact that the handgun’s six-round magazine was still full when officers recovered it. [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/10/us/michael-reinoehl-killing-investigation.html)\n\nYou may remember, after Reinoehl was killed by police, Trump [praised](https://www.vox.com/2020/9/14/21436216/trump-michael-reinoehl-protests-portland-shooting) the officers:\n\n&gt;“Now we sent in the US marshals for the killer, the man that killed the young man in the street,” Trump told Judge Jeanine. “Two and a half days went by, and I put out [on Twitter], ‘When are you going to go get him?’ And the US marshals went in to get in, and in a short period of time, they ended in a gunfight. This guy was a violent criminal, and the US marshals killed him. And I’ll tell you something — that’s the way it has to be. There has to be retribution when you have crime like this.”\n\n&gt;During his rally on Saturday night in Minden, Nevada, Trump alluded to Reinoehl’s killing and lauded US marshals for doing a “great job,” adding, darkly, “you know what I mean.”",

Think in terms of mature and effective threat prevention for your private network, assuming you have a private network you still need to maintain and secure. This is a limiting factor with their solution, so it's advisable that you still keep edge and/or DC firewalls inline their solution and the private resources you're dishing out to your user/non-user endpoints.\n\nZscaler does have the \"Cloud Firewall\" that adds some layer of protection, and they can even extend that down to the edge, but it's not so easy to design, manage and support. \n\nCato provides all security services inline between all users (and non-users) from branch to anywhere...from datacenter to datacenter....cloud to cloud, etc. The idea is that their cloud platform sits in between all edges, regardless of the type of edge.",

Cato - no idea although I believe Netskope has almost 50% more POPs (130 vs 170) but check this. \n\nRegardless it was a huge challenge to implement. Make sure you get good support from the vendor during your rollout. Take a look at their Dedicated IPs offering, expensive but much more reliable for critical apps. Once you have it in, the visibility is next level - the TLS interception massively helps with threat detection. So much visibility and control. Good luck with your journey 👍",

Each supplier is going to do it's best to emphasize this point in a way that reflects the biggest possible number, assuming the number is what's most important to the customer. \n\nCompanies like Netskope and Zscaler count datacenters, which don't always reflect the true global footprint/distribution in a way that resonates with global organizations. Cato counts unique markets they are in versus datacenters. If you're a global organization and care about distribution of coverage, then the market count is probably most important. It doesn't matter as much that you have (5) Datacenters in London and so that adds (5) to your overall PoP count. It matters more, assuming you can support the customer load, that you have presence in London. To that extent, Cato is as distributed (or even more distributed) as Netskope. Zscaler is not so distributed. They have a high datacenter count, but they don't have service symmetry within those Datacenters or markets. This dilutes their count/distribution a bit more.  \n\nSome numbers right off their respective websites:\n\nCato Networks - 87 unique markets (service symmetry)  \nNetskope - 77 unique markets (service symmetry)  \nZscaler - 68 unique markets (service asymmetry, not all markets have all services available for all customers)",

Their solution was/is purpose built to address the real challenges for enterprises that drove SASE to surface, e.g. reducing risk by reducing complexity. If you consider this point, then there really aren't many options out there that compete or come close to Cato. That being said, there are other solutions that do a part of SASE very well, and as good as Cato. Consider Netskope, for example, really strong on the Cloud App Security side of things. This was their focus from the onset and it's clear they are the market leader there. Zscaler really showed strength earlier on with Cloud based internet security. They focused on a world that would be nothing but HTTP/s. They do that part really well. Considering the world is not yet solely HTTP/s, if you're needs extend out to other ports/protocols and use cases, Zscaler has it's shortcomings.\n\nIf your goal is really a strategy that mirrors that of the goals of SASE then Cato really is the leader in the space. It doesn't do every little thing (yet) as well as the one thing that other suppliers might do...but it does everything better than any other supplier trying to do everything does.

Some will be great some probably not so great.  \n\nYou can inspect private traffic with ZIA+ZPA customers do it all the time for DLP. I would argue that \"disparate\" is optimized. Why have Internet traffic go through a connector vs a separate processing node just focused on that traffic? \n\nIn terms of the charging for burst, there was a time when Palo was indeed charging for that. Perhaps it is different now though I do still see their SLA still states their latency for Prisma excludes scaling events.

        "selftext": "Hey Apes, Crux here. I found another part of the Citadel Empire that I have not been able to find any media reporting on. This one involves a political think tank, or some kind of philanthropic venture, that Ken Griffin is starting named “Griffin Catalyst.”\n\n**First**, the domain griffincatalyst.com was registered to Citadel on September 21, 2021: [https://www.whois.com/whois/griffincatalyst.com](https://www.whois.com/whois/griffincatalyst.com)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0c4lslttfq5a1.png?width=688&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a80fd9b01d1932b6c7b0a256da121549dd0fd772\n\n**Second**, a trademark for “Griffin Catalyst” was filed less than a month ago, on November 23, 2022: [https://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4804:dllhjk.7.1](https://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4804:dllhjk.7.1) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gbxondnwfq5a1.jpg?width=336&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f70271d542af2cb2dbc1d2dadea2932be411b7b9\n\nThe address listed is Citadel’s new Miami headquarters, and the owner is **CE TM Holdings LLC**, which I have [previously reported on as the entity holding Citadel’s intellectual property](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/pxn9zj/alpha_league_mercury_dark_ignition_better_markets/). \n\nThe “Goods and Services” filed with the trademark breaks down what this could be related to (emphasis mine):\n\n&gt;IC 035. US 100 101 102. G &amp; S: philanthropic services, namely, promoting public awareness of charitable, philanthropic, public policy, and humanitarian activities; promoting public interest and awareness in the fields of advancing democracy, healthcare, scientific and medical research, economic mobility and community development; **public advocacy to promote awareness and improvement in the fields of advancing democracy, healthcare, scientific and medical research, economic mobility and community development**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;IC 036. US 100 101 102. G &amp; S: philanthropic and charitable services, namely, **providing gifts to charitable organizations and social entrepreneurs in the fields of advancing democracy, healthcare, scientific and medical research, economic mobility and community development**; charitable foundation services, namely, providing financial assistance for programs and services of others; philanthropic services, namely, **providing capital in the form of grants, gifts, investments and other means for programs and services that provide societal benefit through scientific and medical research, technology, and economic empowerment**; financial sponsorship of research and development in the fields of scientific and medical research and technology  \n&gt;  \n&gt;IC 041. US 100 101 107. G &amp; S: **arranging and conducting educational congresses, educational conferences, meetings in the nature of educational seminars and in-person educational forums, all to discuss issues related to advancing democracy, healthcare, scientific and medical research, economic empowerment and community development**\n\nSo Griffin Catalyst could be a lot of things, but what is interesting about these “Goods and Services” is how they are similar to trademarks filed for other well-known political think tanks like the Heritage Foundation and the Cato Institute.\n\nNote: I picked these because of Griffin’s known republican/libertarian leanings and prior involvement with the Koch Brothers who founded/funded those organizations.\n\n**Heritage Foundation**: [https://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/jumpto?f=doc&amp;state=4810:zyljir.2.60](https://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/jumpto?f=doc&amp;state=4810:zyljir.2.60)\n\n&gt;IC 041. US 100 101 107. G &amp; S: Educational, entertainment and conference services, namely, organizing and conducting cultural events, providing displays and exhibits, conducting educational programs, seminars, lectures, conferences, workshops, providing facilities for educational conventions, providing educational speakers and libraries in the fields of conservative public policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, a strong national defense, the heritage of the United States government, the philosophies of its founders and how they apply to current issues facing the United States; providing on-line publications in the nature of e-books, magazines, newsletters, reports, and brochures in the field of conservative public policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, a strong national defense, the heritage of the United States government, the philosophies of its founders and how they apply to current issues facing the United State; publication of books, magazines, newsletters, annual reports, and brochures in the field of conservative public policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, a strong national defense, the heritage of the United States government, the philosophies of its founders and how they apply to current issues facing the United States.

US 002 005 022 023 029 037 038 050.

FIRST USE: 19770600. FIRST USE IN COMMERCE: 19770600\n\nGriffin Catalyst does not appear to be as defense/criminal justice oriented as Heritage/Cato, but there are similarities, especially when you consider Griffin's politics and his association with the Koch's and others in their network.\n\nI am but a simple ape, but it feels like something is amiss given how Griffin has inserted himself not just into American politics, but [potentially UK politics too](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/s9h488/buying_political_influence_in_the_uk_evidence/).\n\nAnd this action fits the billionaire fraudster’s playbook from the investigative reporters at [Whale Hunting](https://whalehunting.projectbrazen.com/ftx-a-whale-hunters-delight/) / Project Brazen:\n\n* Deflect attention onto your rivals.\n* Build a fake charitable reputation.\n* Buy media influence.\n* Fill political coffers with money.\n* Sportswashing.\n* High-minded, yet empty, promises and words.\n\nI hope I am wrong and Griffin Catalyst is a purely altruistic endeavor.

        "selftext": "A bit of background, I've been in the industry 12 years mostly deploying Cisco and Meraki, occasionally working on other vendor platforms as well. I've experienced enough SD-WAN to understand the main concepts and caveats. These days there are hundreds of solutions on the market, and I don't have the time to explore each one. I'm looking for recommendations on what I'd describe as \"SD-WAN lite.\"\n\n  \nPrimary functionality/requirements:\n\n\\- WAN failover\n\n\\- Simple traffic direction. E.g. VLAN X routes out WAN 1, VLAN Y routes out WAN 2.\n\n\\- Basic IPsec tunneling and failover. Throughput requirements for IPsec are minimal\n\n\\- Ease of management (GUI), but ability to view low level configurations\n\n\\- 5 Gbps + throughput and ability for support of 3000 + users connecting to the internet (majority of traffic will be from the LAN, NATed, and forwarded. No security features required for this)\n\n\\- High availability/SSO pairing or a redundancy pairing setup\n\n\\- Standard traffic analytics and performance\n\n\\- Simple and reasonable licensing requirements (would be nice if the solution continued to function without license renewal)\n\n\\- Simple setup. Ideally has centralized management, but the forwarding logic is maintained locally. Centralized control plane/management requiring numerous beefy servers or proprietary appliances is not ideal.\n\n\\- Quality technical support \n\n\n\nNice to have:\n\n\\- Advanced security features, but would be used infrequently.\n\n\\- Ability to apply templates when deploying.\n\n\\- API based configuration and management.\n\n\\- Netflow support.\n\n\\- BGP support, not a requirement.\n\n  \nFeatures NOT needed/wanted:\n\n\\- Multipathing/WAN bandwidth aggregation through tunneling. \n\n\\- MPLS/VPLS - not required or desired in any manner, whether it's integration or emulation.\n\n\\- Cloud integration with AWS/Azure/Gcloud etc. - unneeded.\n\n\n\nI'll be exploring Peplink in the coming weeks. As for Meraki, the MX model requirements for 5 Gbps + throughput is double the cost of an enterprise router with similar throughput. I understand why, but usage of security features will be minimal in this scenario. I know that Fortinet is a popular solution as well, but I am personally not a fan of their products.\n\n  \nThank you in advance!\n\n",

I've been balls deep in SD-WAN for about 10 years. \n\nPeople in this sub LOVE the Fortinet solution. It's really an engineer's product, which is why it's loved so much around here. Personally I think Fortinet is way too complicated, which is why they give it away for free. It's really just WAN Link Load Balancing rebranded with some additional features. You still have to build the dialup tunnels, internal routing protocols, provisioning strategy, all that stuff is on you. These elements are all part of the reference architecture, but it's the complete opposite of turn key. \n\nVelo is my personal favorite, however we're all waiting for the other shoe to drop with Broadcom right now. No one knows what the future of that product line is at the moment. I really like Silverpeak too, that would be my second pick (now owned by Aruba). \n\nIf you want something dead simple and easy to deploy, Meraki is a good choice. It's for people who just want to connect sites together with some light SD-WAN features",

You can follow fortinet guides or continue using the routing protocols and architecture you use today since fortigates are capable of handling almost all network technologies you throw at it. The SD-WAN feature makes it easy to combine those interfaces to have load-balancing, SLA monitoring, different routing path depending on the type of trafic,etc. on top of your network architecture without the need to think about asymmetric routing. For me it's the most robust way to build it as you know already how to troubleshoot your network and it's usually easier to troubleshoot than a blackbox that \"does everything automagically\". I hate Merakis for this, it just works that's true, but when it doesn't it isn't as easy to fix. If you don't have a good network, yes those blackboxes work great.",

They want to write a check and be handed the keys to a fully furnished home, all of the steps in between are just a nuisance.\n\nIn this analogy, r/networking is comprised almost entirely of people in the home *building* business. Most people just need a place to live. They don't care what's behind the walls, they just care about the roof not collapsing, the foundation not cracking, or the pipes not leaking. They want to know how many square feet, how many bedrooms, and if it comes with the hot tub they saw in the brochure. They don't care about the science of how concrete is mixed, or what forest the logs were harvested from.",

VLAN X routes out WAN 1, VLAN Y routes out WAN 2.\n\n  \nThat's not SDWAN...that's policy-based routing, and something nearly every firewall can do.\n\n  \nSDWAN, IMO, is poricy-based routing, on crack.  Regular health-checks and on-box performance monitoring of multiple links and dynamically routing traffic over the best link(s) for the type of traffic -- voice goes over the lowest-jitter link; OneDrive goes over the highest-speed link, for an example.  VPNs between remote sites follow the same types rules (you have VPNs over each link and choose the best for the type of traffic based upon health/performance check SLAs).  Depending on topology and business needs, this may even be a full/partial-mesh VPN with tunnels dynamically generated.  \n\nAnd really...all the vendors do this about the same, too.  IMO it's a matter of which platforms you are comfortable with, which vendors you have a good relationship/experience with, and what integrates well with your existing and near-future tools.  (i.e. can it get user/device information from your NAC/MDM/SSO/IPAM? Is that valuable to routing decisions or logs?).  And of course, budget.\n\n  \nFortinet does tick all your boxes.  L7 firewalling is their meat-and-potatoes and their SDWAN is a very mature pillar of that platform.  I'm a bit of a forti-fanboi though, so take with a grain of salt.\n\nI will say this, my observation of the state of SDWAN....there are a few lineages of modern SDWAN appliances and where they came from.  Knowing their lineage will help in generalizing which will best suit your needs, as this tends to be where they really shine.\n\n  \n\\- WAN Optimization -- Silverpeak came from this family.\n\n\\- Firewalling and L4+ security -- Fortinet came from this family\n\n\\- SaaS On-Ramping -- Aryaka came from this family\n\n\\- Route-based VPN -- Cisco/Viptella came from this family.",

Scaling to over a hundred locations with these configs adds a lot of work to the senior engineer's queues, whether it is troubleshooting or the requests which require temporary policy changes.

Google resume templates, tons of free ones. Make sure they're ATS friendly. Back to the main point, the formatting is so off-putting that I didn't bother to read anything closely. Rule of thumb, if the one page (really should be just one page btw) makes your eyes hurt just seeing it, no one is going to take the time to really read it. I'm betting that the bullet points are repetitive between jobs. If so, every bullet point should be unique even if it's the same position from company to company. Use each point to highlight a different skill, or word it differently. Also include some numbers. Something quantitative carries more weight. \n\nGood luck to him!!!\n\nEdit: typo",

Extample:\n\n&gt;Network Analyst &amp; Project Manager:\n\n&gt;\\- Managed network of xxxx devices mostly on Cisco devices with xx% of average uptime and yy score of customer satisfaction  \n\\- Led  cabling projects for xx buildings, both fiber and copper\n\nobvious that someone who manged a network can do network diagrams, access remote devices, diagnose issues; and recruiters won't waste time reading obvious things. With all due respect: BNC cables haven't been used since 2010: how is it relevant to know someone knows beside providing that feeling of \"I have nothing relevant so filling up however I can\".\n\nIf he focuses on being a specialist on one thing, that thing must be perfect: those listed listed under \"technologies\" are not technologies, they are protocols. Technologies would be TCP/IP networking or virtualization.\n\nBut most of all I'd say he should try to make it a bit more human with some personal traits/non-technical skills: \"analytical troubleshooting, training\" or whatever would make understand in which environment he would do his best (has initiative or prefer to be instructed?).\n\nHope this helps, good luck to you and dad!\n\nNot a solution but while he searches for his next job he may get involved in some volunteering: every kind of non-profit has a network or deals with internet/PC problems; if you dad gets known for this he may make contacts and some money fixing people's/small businesses' issues (wifi printer not working, etc.)",

        "title": "CATO's Freedom in the 50 States: Positions of Orthodox American Libertarians ",
        "selftext": "If you weren’t aware, the Cato Institute’s “Freedom in the 50 States” is the definitive libertarian analysis of how free American states are in social, personal, and economic realms, state by state, policy by policy.\n\nThe tome starts with 100 pages of theory roughly defining freedom and ends with the dirty regulatory secrets of every one of the Stars &amp; Stripes. Of most interest is in between, where it provides the kosher libertarian review on over 26 policy domains, broken into fiscal, regulatory, and personal freedom buckets.\n\nCurious to see what authors William P. Ruger and Jason Sorens had to say in this 6th edition — especially regarding the Empire State, crown jewel of America — I went through and categorized every policy stance they hold. Reflecting my own biases, I’ve divided them into *The Good, The Meh,* and *The Ugly.* My own attitudes divide between pragmatic economic policies that libertarians share at times, and pragmatic social policies that libertarians often denounce. Feel free to dispute or endorse for collective discussion and education.\n\nPrepare for a whirlwind of 1001 things that libertarians are *against*! (And, saving you the specious cost estimates of how much things like trans-fats bans are taking from Uncle Sam's wallet!\n\n# The Good\n\n* **Land Use Policy** —&gt; Against land use regulations/zoning laws, for the right to business owners to prohibit employees from bringing guns into their parking lot (hilarious stance but consistent)\n* **Labor Market** —&gt; Against requirements for verification of legal resident status.\n* **Occupations** —&gt; Pro-expansive scope of practice laws in medicine, Nurse Licensure Compact (and licensure compacts in general)\n* **Miscellaneous Regulations** —&gt; Against certificates of need for hospital construction, moving company entry regulations, pro direct-to-consumer automobile sales, pro interstate insurance product regulation compact\n   * [Good call by Cato, this is up there with the Jones Act in terms of ridiculousness](https://www.cato.org/commentary/missouris-mover-monopoly#)\n* **Incarceration and Arrests** —&gt; Against arrests for prostitution, marijuana possession, liquor law violations, driver’s license suspensions for drug offenses, loitering, gun possession, collect call rates on phones for prisoners.\n   * Pause on guns — would want evidence on if it's not an effective policing tactic to prevent violent crimes\n* **Marriage Freedom** —&gt; “In our view, state governments should treat marriage as a contract that is ‘registered’ or ‘recorded,’ rather than a personal status that is ‘licensed.’” (76) Fair enough! Also against mandatory blood testing, which I didn’t know the history of but is an invasive approach to STDs ([largely gone now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premarital_medical_examination), done in response to syphilis)\n* **Marijuana Freedom** —&gt; In short, for it\n* **Asset Forfeiture** —&gt; Opposed to proceeds of seized assets going to the agency, or the requirement to file suit for the return of your property \n   * Yeah that’s pretty messed up, good catch Cato\n* **Mala Prohibita** —&gt; Pro fireworks, prostitution, physician-assisted suicide, MMA legalization, DNA samples from criminal suspects without probable cause hearings\n* **Miscellaneous** —&gt; Pro sidewalk and parking space dining, private businesses right to vaccine requirements, against parking minimums\n\n# The Meh\n\n* All their takes on **Fiscal Policy** \\--&gt; They oppose state taxes, government consumption, local taxes, government employment, excessive government debt, etc. on standard crowd-out grounds. \n   * Fair enough, but worth noting that they do absolutely zero evaluation of the benefits from government spending and services. \n* **Land Use Policy** —&gt; Propose the use of homeowners associations as a contractual solution to land-use externalities — which runs counter to freedom to build, in my view. Same issues with deed restrictions, from what I’m aware of. Doesn’t address the perverse incentive of homeowners to restrict housing supply\n* **Land Use Policy** —&gt; Against “renewable portfolio standards,” which require businesses to have a certain proportion of energy from renewable sources. \n   * Not an expert, but: probably inefficient, but maybe a necessary evil given the economics of fossil fuel affordability.\n* **Health Insurance** —&gt; They dislike prior approval rates, bans on financial incentives to providers, standing referrals to specialists, and bans on elimination riders\n* **Labor Market** —&gt; Against stricter-than-federal anti-discrimination laws regarding smoking/marital status/age. \n   * Fair enough to note that anti-discrimination laws can have perverse effects, but I’d need to see data that their costs were outweighing the liberal position of freedom from discrimination. Opposition on the principle that “some discrimination by an employer is okay” is weak, and the fact that it will inevitably happen doesn’t mean there shouldn’t be laws about it in the fraction of cases where it does cause harm that should be addressed by the legal system.\n* **Lawsuits** —&gt; Support “tort reform,” which I take a dim view of. \n   * Using legal costs to businesses as a way to limit the ability of consumers to gain compensation is a cause championed by businesses seeking to avoid paying for harms, IMO. Maybe there are some reasonable reforms to make, but on the balance seems like a bad take.\n* **Occupations** —&gt; Dismissive of how effective sunrise and sunset laws are on occupational licensing boards, which they’re probably right about. Area for reform noted. They support physician assistant prescription authority, which I am wary of from a public health point of view given the opioid epidemic, but don’t have a strong stance on.\n* **Cable and Telecom** —&gt; For telecom deregulation… dunno nothing about this pet issue, but ease of firm entry seems like a fair interest.\n* **Miscellaneous Regulations**\n   * Against automobile insurance rate filing requirements , homeowner’s insurance rate filing requirements —&gt; No clue about these, no opinion. They seem to support something called “[Auto Choice](https://www.cato.org/commentary/auto-insurance-needs-auto-choice#)” that I’d have to read up on. On the other hand, [at least one policy analyst](https://norcalrecord.com/stories/658395251-cato-institute-policy-analyst-it-s-hard-to-get-homeowners-insurance-in-most-of-california) attributed unaffordability of homeowner’s insurance to state price controls and regulations after CA wildfires… I’m inclined to believe that’s convenient attribution, given that wildfires are becoming one of those “[uninsurable](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/09/21/parts-of-america-are-becoming-uninsurable)” situations due to factors beyond silly price laws.\n   * Against price gouging, sales-below-cost laws —&gt; Sure these are stupid in principle, and rarely do anything, but.. they *specifically* call out how price gouging after natural disasters is good ? I respect the contrarianism hustle but that’s just stone deaf\n   * Against mandatory product labeling laws —&gt; They’re right on the cited instances of GMO labeling mandates and California’s expansive carcinogen labels. But I wonder: how far would they take this if they could?\n* **Marriage Freedom** —&gt; For the availability of cousin marriage. (No statement — [NYS one of the most free here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cousin_marriage_law_in_the_United_States), though, so suck it, Cato)\n* **Mala Prohibita** —&gt; Against trans fats bans. “…the policies with the greatest potential costs to victims are racial preferences in the public sector … prostitution prohibition, and trans-fat bans.” (92) Even dropping my public health priorities — how is that not just a laugh-out-loud ranking?\n* **Travel Freedom** —&gt; Against fingerprinting for drivers licenses. I can see how this is beneficial for undocumented workers, but I’m skeptical that there’s much other benefit, and I suspect it would make it much less useful as a form of identification to everyone else. They’re also for availability of licenses for people without Social Security numbers, which seems like a more reasonable half-measure.\n* **Miscellaneous** —&gt; Against extending governors’ power to declare states of emergency (no clue how to feel on that one), and pro alcohol to go (I’ve got mixed but negative views, but probably should be a city-to-city ordinance)\n\n# The Ugly\n\n* **Land Use Policy** —&gt; Against eminent domain and use the term “blight loophole” \n   * ED can be abused, but being pro-infrastructure and against holdout problems, I’m inclined towards eminent domain powers. Not an expert on “blight” — surely has been abused, but I’m inclined to be pragmatic and say even if it has been abused in the past, it can still be a good policy in other instances, ex. abandoned properties\n* **Health Insurance** —&gt; These guys *hate* community ratings and individual mandates, literally because “they represent a large transfer of wealth from the healthy to the unhealthy.” They also dislike essential benefits mandates and mandated external review of grievances (funny timing reading this after the United Health assassination)\n   * Tough to imagine how they’ll address death spirals in insurance markets, underinsured or uninsured populations in the absence of a positive stance here. \n* **Labor Market** —&gt; Against short-term disability requirements, state minimum wage laws, policies for workers’ compensation (funding mechanisms and mandated coverage), mandated parental \n* **Lawsuits** —&gt; Support a punitive or blanket damages cap (ah, yes: *inflexible* legal systems, how considerate to create definite costs-of-doing-business for unethical proprietors), burden of proof of conduct to justify damages (seems biased against victims of harm), and count “plaintiff friendly” factors against states. (In general, Cato seems to hate lawyers)\n   * “In an efficient civil liability system, the costs that defendants have to pay are merely compensation for wrongs and not a limitation on their freedom” (49) — what a bland and uninformative position. Where does a defendant’s freedom start to be infringed upon? Rather mask-off to not even state that the cost ought to be “victim made whole, *and no more*” — at least such a position recognizes harm to the plaintiff in the first place.\n* **Gambling** —&gt; Just totally pro gambling in all sense. Highlight policies for charitable gaming, slot and video machines outside of casinos, and pari-mutuel wagering. \n   * While I think state-sanctioned gambling makes some sense given human nature, I’m not dissuaded from the view that gambling freedom derives very, very regressive profits and creates plenty of externalities that justify its regulation.\n   * To give you an idea of the kind of convenient math Cato likes: “In 2016, sparsely populated Montana raked in a whopping $400 million a year in gross revenue minus payouts, amounting to nearly $500 for every man, woman, and child.” (72-3) *In what world are those $400 million in profits being split among* [not just the men, but the women and children too?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5W2YPKH9XE)\n* **Gun Rights** —&gt; Against universal background checks, licensing or regulation of gun dealers, restriction on purchases of multiple handguns, firearms registration, locking device requirements, ammunition microstamping, training requirements for carry permits, assault weapons bans, large capacity magazine bans, and .50 caliber rifle bans. Those aren’t even my favorites:\n   * Against duty-to-retreat laws —&gt; Holy shit, this is just a blanket opposition to any reasonable standard of cause for the use of violence ! We literally discussed the inefficiencies of stand your ground law on my Economics of Law course ! Make it make sense !\n   * Against *all* the rules of the National Firearms Act —&gt; Machineguns, suppressors, short-barreled rifles, short-barreled shotguns should all be [back on the menu, boys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY4V3UUY95A)\n   * Against “design safety standards” —&gt; On the grounds that it is effectively a ban on cheap guns. The PLCAA already protects gun companies from liability for creating unsafe guns that injure their users — how much more protection from liability do they need?\n   * Against *retention of sales records* —&gt; Even more than all the above, this just convinces me that Cato would see an uptick in crimes involving deadly weapons, with no means of investigating or catching perpetrators, as a fair trade-off for these policy views. [What the fuck are police supposed to do in this world of theirs](https://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/l-p-d-libertarian-police-department)?\n* **Educational Freedom** —&gt; I don’t get the impression that Cato is very impressed by the classic assumption of positive externalities derived from public education…\n   * Pro tax credits/deductions for private schools —&gt; I am rabidly pro public school system, and look at pro-private school policies mostly as driving inequality of education. Public schools often need reform, and it doesn’t need to look like cutting the revenue that funds them.\n   * Against licensure of private schools and their teachers —&gt; Barring cases where states might make these absurdly high, why would this be beneficial to students?\n   * Against years of compulsory schooling —&gt; The children *yearn* for the mines\n   * Against homeschool notification indexes, record-keeping indexes, homeschool teacher qualifications, and homeschool standardized testing —&gt; This has “opening the door to child neglect” vibes, in my view.\n* **Tobacco Freedom** —&gt; They don’t like cigarette taxes, smoking and vaping laws in private businesses, minimum legal sale age at 21, flavored electronic cigarette bans, cigarette vending machine bans, and internet sales regulations. Public health nightmare fuel, surely we can reasonably accommodate regulations on businesses that peddle addictive substances?\n* **Mala Prohibita** —&gt; Against states equal rights amendments, state DNA databases, affirmative action laws, and bans on racial preferences in the public sector. There are reasonable conversations to be had about the costs and benefits of proactive racial policies, but I’m largely for them (I &lt;3 Justice Brennan)\n* **Travel Freedom** —&gt; Against it all… [What’s next](https://www.c-span.org/clip/road-to-the-white-house-2016/user-clip-a-licence-to-make-toast-in-your-own-damn-toaster/4713898)? Against seat belt laws, motorcycle helmet requirements, uninsured/underinsured motorist insurance coverage requirements, sobriety checkpoints, automated license plate reader data\n   * C’mon… you’re against *sobriety checkpoints?* What freedoms are we protecting here?\n* **Campaign Finance Freedom** —&gt; Just [Koch Bros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_network) views.

I've always wanted to see more contributions from libertarian feminists in Cato. I think that would be a positive influence for how those issues are mulled over there. Maybe someday.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5i4ihu76018e1.png?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca50d14e4c9aaba53711335418a7fbb59ef4924d\n\nThey're right. Price gouging is good in those scenarios, public opinion be damned. Now Cato probably isn't so hot about addressing those who miss out on affording those resources, but it's addressable within this sub's approach. Bans on gouging or not, we would want a govt emergency service that gets necessities to those who can't obtain them in a disaster scenario.\n\nI say it's better to let prices do their thing because it leads to allocative efficiency, since suppliers will work to provide more goods to take advantage of the higher price in that scenario. Yes, that means that those who can't afford that price will not be able to buy, but we can then cover the gaps with FEMA and the like. In the opposite scenario, a price ceiling that kicks in for emergencies will lead to perhaps a more \"fair\" distribution of goods based on who gets in line first instead of who is able to pay, but it still ends with a shortage of goods. We still have to use emergency services to get food and water to people in that case, and will likely have to spend even more money on them to make up for the slack left by constrained market supply.\n\nJust some food for thought.

The reason the first part matters is that some vendors do not disclose internally discovered vulnerabilities and silently patch them. This means customers could be running unpatched firmware without realising they are vulnerable. Certain vendors are worse than others for that. Fortinet has a transparent disclosure policy and an aggressive PSIRT team, which leads them to discovering most of their own vulnerabilities (up to 85% is claimed). The second matters… well because of debacles like the recent PANW vulnerability.\n\nEnd of the day, make your own decision.

Hiding things definitely doesn't lead to better outcomes.\n\nThe more aggressive a vendor is in reviewing their own code for vulnerabilities, the more they will find. If they are finding the vulnerabilities, then fixing them and disclosing them, why is that bad?! I **want** all the vendors to be transparent. If vendors aren't looking at their code, they aren't finding their vulnerabilities, which means bad actors might. If they aren't disclosing the ones they do find, then it leaves their customers vulnerable because they have no idea that they need to patch it.\n\nThe real problem isn't disclosing vulnerabilities, as long as there's a patch or workaround (that works) available, It's the people who either don't patch or apply the workarounds because they're not keeping up with their cyber security, or are unable to. Getting people to patch their stuff is probably one of the biggest challenges in cyber security aside from asset management.",

        "selftext": "Right wingers and the super wealthy will be gathering in London this week at the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship (ARC), a group co-founded in 2023 by Jordan Peterson and the Baroness Philippa Stroud (of the Stroud banking family). Financial backers include Paul Marshall, one of the owners of the far right GB News, and various libertarians groups and think tanks. Leaders of the Conservative Party, as well as Reform - a party stacked with prominent libertarians and ex Merrill Lynch investment bankers, as well as Elon Musk, the richest man in the world - will also be present.\n\nFigures on the advisory board of ARC include the former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott, the Tory MP Danny Kruger, the phony \"climate scientist\" Bjørn Lomborg and Tory peer and financier Helena Morrissey.\n\nPeterson will also interview Peter Thiel, the US Republican donor and Silicon Valley billionaire known for asserting that \"democracy is not compatible with freedom\". More than 50 super-wealthy Australians, including figures from rightwing thinktanks and churches, will aso be present. Among these are Bridget McKenzie, a senator for the National party, along with key figures from Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp.\n\nThere is also a strong religious influence on the ARC's direction from Peterson, various anti LGBT spokespeople, and Stroud, a committed Christian credited with shaping many of the policies of the Conservative party during the 2000s. Conservatives and far-right types from the US, UK, Australia and Europe will also attend the conference, including those with links to the new Trump administration. The House speaker, the Republican Mike Johnson, is giving the keynote address.\n\nOther Republicans due to speak include the US Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Vivek Ramaswamy – who has worked with Elon Musk on moves to radically reshape the US government – and Kevin Roberts, the president of the US Heritage Foundation, the think tank behind the “Project 2025” blueprint for Trump’s second term.\n\nThe conference has a distinctly anti-environmental, socially conservative, anti-democratic and right-libertarian theme, a form of gut-the-state libertarianism favoured by the mega-rich. Note that their goals...\n\nhttps://www.vcinfodocs.com/what-is-the-network-state\n\nhttps://www.unqualified-reservations.org/2008/11/patchwork-positive-vision-part-1/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RpPTRcz1no\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Yarvin\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Enlightenment\n\nhttps://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Neoreactionary_movement\n\n...do not seek to meaningfully alter the neoliberalism or capitalist policies favored by their liberal enemies. They seek only a purer, more stripped down form of capitalism (with various protections for oligarchs), with less labour rights, less environtal protections, less regulated business, and with third world labour augmented by a homegrown underclass, as seen in Victorian England or pre New Deal USA.\n\n(for example, in this first term, Trump removed rules protecting workers from silicosis/lung disease caused by exposure to silica dust, all of which led to a large uptake in worker deaths. He similarly rolled back workplace safety standards and inspection rules, which resulted in minority workers suffering the highest workplace fatality rates in decades, all at the behest of rich corporate owners)\n\nPeterson himself has always been awash in mega-rich dark money. He is plugged into the Koch network, and has partnered with Jeff Sandefer (to start the \"Peterson Fellowship\" at the Acton School of Business), a billionaire oilman who acquired 17 billion barrels of Australian shale oil reserves in a controversial deal, and pumped much of the profits into bankrolling conservative non-profits, in tandem with other Big Business and Big Oil groups. These non-profits include the American Phoenix Foundation, notorious for strapping hidden cameras onto operatives in order to track and illegally film politicians, essentially for the purposes of blackmail or ousting political opponents.\n\nPeterson's partner Sandefer also runs the Ed Foundation, a philanthropic tax-exempt organization that spreads cash to dozens of right wing causes. For example it dishes out about 5 million dollars in grants a year to conservative groups like the Texas Public Policy Foundation (a climate denying, Koch funded group of which Sandefer is a boardmember), Empower Texans, and AgendaWise.\n\nSandefer is also part of a network...\n\nhttps://www.texasobserver.org/revealed-the-corporations-and-billionaires-that-fund-the-texas-public-policy-foundation/\n\n...including the Koch Brothers, TXU, Exxon, Energy Future Holdings and numerous other Big Insurance, Big Tobacco, Big Energy groups, intent on privatizing education and removing all intellectual resistance to corporations (Sandefer-backed schools have consistently performed below national averages).\n\nPeterson himself constantly retweets right-wing think tanks (Heritage, Cato, TPUSA, Heartland etc), many of which are funded by the Kochs, the second largest private corporation in the US, with numerous oil and gas interests and who control the largest oil and gas fields in his hometown of Alberta, Canada.\n\nHe also promotes Koch and conservative dummy donation groups (the Leadership Institute, DonorsTrust and Donors Capital Fund etc). He also pushes right wing, libertarian groups like the Randian Atlas Society, Archbridge Institute and the Atlas Network. The Atlas Network is particularly nefarious. It receives millions from ExxonMobile, Big Tobacco (Philip Morris), Koch foundations, and has pumped millions into backing violent, far-right causes in places like Brazil and Venezuela, and millions more into social media propaganda. According to journalist Lee Fang, writing for The Intercept, the libertarian Atlas Network has \"reshaped political power in country after country, operating as an extension of U.S. foreign policy, with Atlas-affiliated think tanks receiving funding from the United States Department of State and the National Endowment for Democracy.\"\n\nPeterson himself was given about 200,000 dollars by Ezra Levant, who's a protege of the Kochs and a fellow of the Koch's Fraser Institute and the Institute for Humane Studies, both Koch funded/libertarian think tanks. Levant's far right company, Rebel Media, was also given starter money by Koch seeder companies, like the Middle East Forum, or the Horowitz Freedom Centre through the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation.\n\nPeterson's favorite \"environmentalist\", is himself not a scientist, routinely posts deliberately misleading data (http://www.realclimate.org/images//Bjorn_Lomborg_Sea_Level_Rise.png) and (https://thinkprogress.org/bjorn-lomborg-is-part-of-the-koch-network-and-cashing-in-68dab8cf68/) is himself part of the same Koch network, and in the past has received almost a million dollars (that we know of) in donations from conservative foundations. His other favorite \"climate scientists\" are crank Anthony Watts and Richard Lindzen, a widely denounced shill who worked for Big Oil, the Heartland Institute and Cato Institute, and who once shilled/lied for Big Tobacco.\n\nNote that the people Peterson loves to interview tend to be sponsored by Learn Liberty, which was launched by the Institute for Humane Studies, largely funded by Charles Koch. When he's not platforming these folk (his buddy Dave Rubin is similarly bankrolled by Learn Liberty), he also loves retweeting Maxime Bernier. Bernier was the executive vice president of the Montreal Economic Institute, a think tank funded by the libertarian Atlas Network, itself funded by Koch-affiliated groups. The MEI pushes a form of social organization simliar to feudal Japan, with little corporate feifdoms within fiefdoms, free from government oversight.\n\nPeterson also recently allied with Doug Ford, a conservative multi-millionaire who worked with various Christian groups to oppose and roll back a new Canadian school curriculum which sought to protect gay and trans kids from bullying. Ford was supported by RightNow, an anti-abortion group which rallies Christian voters and which has received support and training from the Leadership Institute, a right-wing U.S. training organization funded heavily by the Koch Brothers donor network.\n\nAnd of course Peterson recently lectured at the 42nd Annual Trilateral Commission, giving speeches to rooms full of Goldman Sachs boardmembers, central bankers, and ex Prime Ministers. The Trilateral Commission, hardly a place for underdogs (as Peterson likes to portray himself), is a supranational gathering of world power brokers, aimed at steering interzonal politics by deciding policies and economic priorities that are never subjected to the democratic approval of the nations under their gaze. In other words, a real life uber-capitalist example of the \"postmodern neo Marxist conspirators\" Peterson imagines everywhere. That the most powerful men in the world promote Peterson's brand of esoteric libertarian eschatology shouldn't be surprising. Indeed, Chomsky predicted it decades ago:\n\n\"The Trilateral Commission was concerned with trying to induce what they called \"more moderation in democracy\"—turn people back to passivity and obedience so they don't put so many constraints on state power and so on. In particular they were worried about young people. They were concerned about the institutions responsible for the indoctrination of the young (that's their phrase), meaning schools, universities, church and so on—they're not doing their job, the young are not being sufficiently indoctrinated. They're too free to pursue their own initiatives and concerns and you've got to control them better.\"\n\nThese mega rich groups, and libertarians, are attempting to seduce voters with \"anti immigration\", \"low tax\" and \"efficiency\" rhetoric. Meanwhile, in the real world, capitalism's grow-or-die imperative requires a constant influx of people to jack up production/consumption rates to avoid collapse (all low-immigration nations, like Hungary or Japan, have reversed their stances or suffered economic problems, low birth rates, brain drain etc), so to make \"low immigration\" nations work will require even starker levels of inequality.\n\nThese types also heavily promote the idea that \"government is wastefully spending\". But the debt a government incurs is always precisely the debt it removes from the civilian population (they don't understand why), and the money governments spend inexorably ends up in the real economy, where it cycles into the hands of ordinary people.\n\nThe rich have likewise convinced people that \"no tax\" and \"more efficiency\" is \"logical\", but this itself is a piece of propaganda with a very specific aim.\n\nConsider, for example, what would happen with entirely no tax. Tax, contrary to common understanding, is simply money that is immediately digitally destroyed. It is the primary way in which the money supply is prevented from expanding, so giddily ending tax inexorably leads to more inflation or an expanding underclass. The rich say this won't happen because growth increases will tricke down, but studies show us precisely where this growth goes (four out of every five dollars of wealth generated in 2017 ended up in the pockets of the richest one percent, while the poorest half of humanity got nothing. The following year, 82 percent of the wealth generated last year went to the richest one percent of the global population).\n\nThe idea of giddily \"ending waste\" is similarly silly. Every single dollar under capitalism is created as debt at interest, such that aggregate dollars in circulation are always less than aggregate debts owed. So \"waste\" (debt) is always inherently more than money or profit. Cutting wasteful spending, or even entirely abolishing government altogether, has zero effect on this fundamental contradiction. The rich only pull the \"efficiency\" card because they're looking to privatize state assets, or remove corporate tax while placing austerity measures on the public.\n\nMoreover, UN reports show that every business sector is unprofitable once environmental externalities are tabulated. In other words, all business sectors are inherently more wasteful than profitable. This is itself a fundamental thermodynamic law: the total order of a thing/commodity is always less than the total disorder/chaos/debt/entropy engendered by its creation.\n\nSo the common argument that \"government is bloated and not balanced\" misses the point that capitalism itself functions as a debt ponzi even without government! This is because virtually all money is endogenously created as debt with interest, because aggregate debts always inherently outpace aggregate money in circulation (hence you can never \"balance the economy\" in aggregate, without screwing over someone or some other nation), because most growth flows toward those with a monopoly on land and credit, because rates of return on capital outpace growth (ie no net trickle down), because banks never pump full profits into the real economy (and so the economy is worse than negative sum), because velocity is never high enough, because interest compounds (especially as the same money is lent or extended to multiple parties), and because workers are never paid in aggregate enough to purchase what they produce in aggregate (setting up inevitable cycles of overproduction and underconsumption, which help set up business cycles).\n\nGiven all this, you cannot \"end waste\" or \"balance the system\" like libertarians imagine possible. Rather, all profit constitutes (like a Monopoly boardgame) violence toward others in the system, as all profit tends to push others elsewhere off the board and into debt and so poverty (hence why 44 percent of the US lives below a living wage and why 80 percent of the planet lives on less than 10 dollars a day, 45ish percent of whom live on less than 1.75). The value of the dollar in your pocket is likewise always dependent on the global majority having none.\n\nNo JP/Musk/Conservative/fascist dream-alliance and scapegoating will solve this. Nor has it ever. Only silly people think this, because they think a global system functions like a household budget. It's also why right-libertarian policies always speed-run toward feudalism.\n\nBut the real reason people are radicalized into focusing on \"government waste\", is because the rich know that an expanding money supply leads to inflation, and that managing this money supply means removing money from the system. And to do this, one can do three things: taxation on the wealthiest, removing wealth from the poorest, or government austerity cuts. As the last two options involve the poorest suffering, rather than the richest, these are what the rich are ideologically incentivized to push, and to con people into adopting.\n\nSo \"government efficiency\" is just a pretext for conning the public into accepting the erosion of bodies that protected them, freeing up assets for privatization, and lowering corporate tax. It's gut-the-state libertarianism masquerading as \"efficiency\".\n\nThe current libertarian take-over of government (https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Libertarianism, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Enlightenment), for the process of gutting government, has always been the wet dream of oligarchs and the super rich, who recognize that government is one of the few ways ordinary people can protect themselves from exploitation. Remove government, and you've removed resistance.",

        "title": "Elon, Sulla, and an Ideological Suicide Note - How to fuck a Republic in three years flat (SPEEDUN, any%)",
        "selftext": "Hey everyone, just a little musing I dropped off the top of my head, while I'm mulling doing a philosophical breakdown of Continental European conservatism philosophies, parties and a \"where are they now\" to explain why Europe's conservatism is more paternalistic than the American model, and whether there's any philosophical truths or points that might make things applicable in the Anglosphere. Until then, enjoy! \n\n\\------------- \n\nSo Elon Musk, the fella determined to colonise Mars, disrupt the auto industry, and apparently solve world peace by being the richest shitposter alive, has a new hobby: quoting Roman dictators on Twitter. \n\nIn January 2025, he casually dropped this little gem into the timeline: \"“Nemo me impune lacessit” – Sulla\" \n\n\"The proscriptions of Marius forced the proscriptions of Sulla\" \n\nA few months earlier, he'd responded to some random bloke's tweet about political corruption by casually dropping references to the guy who innovated state-sanctioned murder lists like dinner party conversation starters: \n\n\"Perhaps we just need a modern day Sulla\" For most people scrolling past, these probably register as just more Musk eccentricities, alongside his promises of letting the history books know that their government was gutted open by a meme dog. \n\nBut for anyone with even a passing knowledge of Roman history, this is the equivalent of tweeting \"You know who had some interesting crowd control techniques? Pol Pot.\" What Musk is doing here isn't just the random musings of a bloke who's had too many drinks; they're revealing statements from America's Shogun (not to be confused with Douglas MacArthur, the American Shogun) about his political philosophy. Because here's the thing – Sulla wasn't just any old Roman strongman. \n\nHe was so spectacularly destructive that within a generation of his death, literally everyone in Roman politics – conservatives, progressives, and everyone in between – was falling over themselves to position themselves as the \"anti-Sulla.\" Even the ones who agreed with his policies couldn't disavow themselves fast enough from his methods. \n\nWhen the world's richest man starts channelling one of history's most notorious political butchers, we should probably pay attention. Not because Musk himself is about to march his Tesla factory workers on Washington, but because his comments normalise and mainstream some genuinely dangerous ideas about power, governance and political violence - especially when that same guy controls satellite networks, social media platforms, an ever-growing stable of companies with government contracts, or you know, said government. \n\nSo buckle up, and let's talk why he clearly doesn't understand about Sulla's legacy, and why anyone who positions themselves as a modern Sulla is essentially writing their own ideological suicide note. He's basically announcing to the world: \"I admire a political approach that was so toxic it poisoned everyone associated with it for generations.\" \n\n\\-------------------------- \n\nBefore we dive into Sulla's particular brand of fuckery, we need a bit of context about Roman politics. You can't understand why Sulla was such a catastrophe without grasping the broader political landscape he was operating in. \n\nWhy is Rome so relevant? \n\nBecause beyond the slave economy and stratified aristocracy and limited suffrage and how state-and-religion intertwined, there was one thing that defined Romans - they were legalistic and institutional. They LOVE the law and their rights and their rights afforded to their citizenship. Romans love the law and their institutions and procedural norms like Egyptians loved bureaucracy, Hellenes loved philosophy and Illyrians loved soldiery. \n\nAnd The Romans had an elaborate social hierarchy that makes modern class divisions look egalitarian: \n\nPatricians – the original aristocratic families, the old money, the ones who could trace their lineage back to Rome's founding and the overthrow of the Tarquinian kings. Primarily landowners. \n\nEquites (or Eques, or Equestrians, because they and can afford a horse when mustering for battle. And yes, their modern translation is something to the tune of \"knights\") – the business class, the Roman equivalent of the bourgeoisie. These were the entrepreneurs, merchants, tax collectors, and contractors who made their money through commerce rather than land. \n\nPlebeians – originally everyone else, though over time this group developed its own elite known as the plebeian nobility. If patricians were the lords, these were the commons – but with some very wealthy and powerful commons at the top. \n\nThese divisions weren't just academic distinctions – they structured every aspect of Roman society and created the fundamental tensions that would eventually blow the Republic apart. By the Sulla's time in the Late Republic, these old class distinctions had evolved into political factions: \n\nOptimates (\"the best men\"... according to themselves) – They favoured the Senate's authority, traditional hierarchies, and the rights of the wealthy. Think of them as the establishment, the status quo defenders, the \"we've always done it this way\" crowd. These were the conservatives who believed Rome's success came from its traditional institutions and were suspicious of change. \n\nPopulares (\"favouring the people\") – the populists of their day. They championed the power of popular assemblies over the Senate and pushed for land reform, grain subsidies, and expanding citizenship. Think of them as the ancient equivalent of modern liberal-reformists-progressives, complete with all the contradictions that entails – many of their leaders were wealthy aristocrats who LARPed as champions of the common people to advance their own careers and used popular support as a power base against their Senate rivals – but they did advocate for policies that benefited average Romans. \n\nThis wasn't a formal two-party system, but more like competing political styles and ideologies. Julius Caesar came from the populares tradition; Cato the Younger was a staunch optimate. \n\nNow, the Conflict of the Orders (494-287 BCE) was basically the original class struggle – a centuries-long tension between patricians (the aristocratic old money families) and plebeians (everyone else who wasn't a slave or foreigner). It wasn't just rich versus poor; it was about political rights, representation, and who got to have a say in governance. The patricians initially had all the power – they controlled the Senate, religious positions, and held most government offices. The plebs, despite being the vast majority of citizens, were effectively shut out of power. Through a series of strikes, protests, and threatened secessions (the plebs literally said \"fuck this\" and threatened to leave Rome and form their own city at one point), they gradually won concessions – creating their own assembly (the Plebeian Council), and eventually gaining access to all political offices. \n\nOver centuries, the plebeians organized and fought for representation, eventually winning the right to elect their own representatives, the Tribunes of the Plebs. These tribunes had the power to veto laws and protect plebeian interests. Their persons were declared sacrosanct, meaning anyone who harmed them could be killed without trial. That's how seriously Romans took this shit. \n\nOn paper, this looked like a victory for democracy and equality. In practice, Rome developed into what we'd now call an oligarchy, where a small group of wealthy families (both patrician and plebeian) dominated politics through the Senate. Not an elected body, the Senate was composed of former magistrates and served as Rome's primary governing council. \n\nThe Social Wars (91-87 BCE) were a different kettle of fish entirely. No, this wasn't Romans unfriending each other... but also technically yes. These weren't about class but about citizenship. Rome's Italian allies (socii in Latin, hence \"Social War\"), who had contributed soldiers and taxes to Rome's expansion but were denied citizenship and its benefits and got sick of being treated like second-class subjects. They wanted full Roman citizenship with all its rights and privileges. When Rome played hardball, they revolted and formed their own confederation. After several years of bloody fighting, Rome eventually granted citizenship to the Italian allies – but the conflict destabilized the Republic, it militarised domestic politics and created armies loyal to individual generals rather than the state, setting the stage for the rise of military strongmen. \n\nOh, and before Sulla, there were Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus– populares reformers and brothers who tried to redistribute public land to the poor and got brutally murdered for their troubles. Tiberius was beaten to death with chair legs by senators in 133 BCE, while Gaius committed suicide in 121 BCE to avoid capture by his opponents. Their deaths effectively proved that the Roman elite would resort to violence rather than accept reform through established channels. \n\nAnd then there was Gaius Marius, a new man (novus homo) who rose from humble origins to become Rome's greatest general. He reformed the army, opening it to the landless poor who swore loyalty to their general for land grants upon retirement rather than the state – just a lil teensy-weensy change that wouldn't do TOO much for the stability of the Republic. Only a seemingly technical change that had soldiers now looking to their commanders for future opportunity. Marius was a populares and allied with populares politicians and was a seven-time consul (unheard of!). \n\nGot all that? This was the world Sulla stepped into – class conflict, regional tensions, precedents for political violence, and an increasingly personalised military. \n\nSo what did he do? Make things worse. \n\n\\---------------------------------------- \n\nSulla began as Marius's lieutenant before becoming his bitter enemy. When in 88 BCE, he was elected consul and the Senate awarded Sulla command of the war against Mithridates (a lucrative opportunity, to avenge a king whose forces massacred thousands of Romans in Asia Minor) and was busy preparing his troops, Marius's allies used the Popular Assembly to transfer command to Marius instead. It was legal, if unprecedented. \n\nSulla's response? Instead of accepting the democratic decision, he marched his legions on Rome – breaking the sacred boundary of the city (the pomerium) that no army was supposed to cross. This wasn't just illegal; it was sacrilegious, a violation of centuries of Roman tradition, the original boundary lines of Rome ploughed by founder, king and asscended God Romulus/Quirinus. Legally, Rome existed only within the pomerium; everything beyond it was simply territory belonging to Rome. \n\nThis was the Roman equivalent of the Joint Chiefs deciding to occupy Washington because the president passed over someone for appointment. \n\nAfter driving Marius into exile, Sulla forced through legislation favourable to himself, then left to fight Mithridates. While he was away, Marius returned, seized power, and conducted a purge of Sulla's supporters. When Marius died of natural causes in 86 BCE (before Sulla could get to him), his faction remained in control under Cinna. \n\nSulla returned in 83 BCE, defeated his opponents in battle, and declared himself dictator – a temporary emergency position that had previously been limited to six months and required the Senate to renew it. Sulla made his dictatorship indefinite (\"for as long as he saw fit\"). His stated mission? To \"restore the Republic\" from populist excesses. And used it to unleash a reign of terror. \n\nThe \"proscriptions\" were Sulla's signature innovation – public lists of enemies of the state in the Forum who could be killed by anyone, with rewards for their killers, including the confiscation of the dead's property to the killers or to the state and punishments for those who helped the proscribed - by joining the list themselves. Thousands died, including about 40 senators and 1,600 equites, and their descendants were barred from public office. Estimates vary, but somewhere between 1,000 and 9,000 Romans were executed – not just political opponents but often wealthy people whose only crime was having property and wealth Sulla or his supporters wanted. \n\nSulla's victims weren't just killed; they were erased. Their descendants were barred from public office. This wasn't just political elimination but political annihilation. Sulla even had Marius's body exhumed and desecrated. That's the action of a man a few bundles short of a fasces. \n\nAll this was supposedly to \"restore the Republic\" and \"strengthen institutions.\" Sound familiar? It's the same bullshit line trotted out by every wannabe strongman from Napoleon to Putin. \n\n\\-------------- \n\nWhat made Sulla's three-year reign so catastrophic wasn't just the number of people killed, but the precedents it established: \n\nUsing the army against domestic political opponents? Sure, it's just a political tool. \n\nSystematically eliminating political enemies through state-sanctioned murder. \"Don't quote the law to men with swords\" - Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus, famed general and at this point in time, Sulla's toady.\n\nUsing confiscated property to reward supporters? Of course! \n\nTreating political opponents as enemies deserving death rather than legitimate adversaries? What could possibly go wrong? \n\nBreaking sacred constitutional boundaries whenever convenient? Don't worry, it'll buff out. \n\nDoubled the size of the Senate (packing it with his supporters), limited the power of tribunes (weakening the only officials directly representing common citizens), and codified various procedures? Easy peasy! \n\nBut his \"restoration\" was a sham. By violating the Republic's most sacred norms, Sulla destroyed the very thing he claimed to be saving. He showed ambitious generals like Caesar that the path to power ran through conquest of Rome itself, not through foreign conquest. He demonstrated that constitutional rules were just suggestions for those with enough military force. \n\nWhen Sulla voluntarily stepped down in 79 BCE (his only redeeming action, actually believing enough in the republican system to eventually resign) and died a year later of a stomach haemorrhage after a massive bender , he believed he'd saved Rome's traditional order. In reality, he'd created the blueprint for its destruction, the constitutional cancer he'd introduced metastasizing over the next three decades. He composed his own epitaph: \"No friend ever served me, and no enemy ever wronged me, whom I have not repaid in full.\"\n\nAnd yes, he did this in just THREE years. Let that sink in. Less than the official term of the elected Censors.\n\nHe managed to do more lasting damage to Rome's constitutional fabric than centuries of external enemies had managed, from Lars Porsenna of Clusium, the Veii, Brennus the Gaul who ACTUALLY invaded and temporarily seized Rome, and Hannibal himself. \n\nIn just three years, Sulla rewired Rome's political DNA and philosophy on a fundamental level. Before him, no Roman general had ever marched on Rome with legions except to throw off an occupier like Brennus – it was literally unthinkable, a religious and political taboo. After Sulla, it became a viable political strategy. Before Sulla, political violence was sporadic and generally defensive. After Sulla, state-sanctioned political murder became a tool of governance. \n\n\\------------------------- \n\nHere's where it gets interesting, and why any modern figure praising Sulla should make you double-check your boxes of democracy, soap, ballot, jury and the Rule V box.\n\nAfter Sulla's death, something remarkable happened: practically everyone in Roman politics – even his former allies and ideological bedfellows – began distancing themselves from his methods and legacy. \n\nSulla saw potential in young Pompey the Great, who earned the nickname \"the young butcher\" for his enthusiastic participation in the proscriptions. Sulla granted him extraordinary commands despite his relative inexperience. Yet what did Pompey do once Sulla was safely underground? He immediately began repositioning himself. In 70 BCE, he joined forces with Marcus Licinius Crassus to restore the powers of the tribunes that Sulla had gutted – essentially dismantling one of his mentor's signature \"reforms.\" Throughout his career, Pompey consistently presented himself as more moderate than Sulla, more inclusive, less hardline. \n\nAs for Marcus Porcius Cato (Cato the Younger), the poster boy of Roman conservatism? If anyone should have approved of Sulla's \"restore the Republic\" agenda, it should have been Cato – someone so obsessed with traditional Roman values that he deliberately wore outdated clothing and cultivated an archaic speaking style as a political statement. Yet Cato carefully avoided association with Sulla's methods. He advocated for constitutional solutions rather than Sullan-style proscriptions. His famous rigid principles never extended to endorsing the elimination of political opponents, no matter how much he disagreed with them, up to and including the soon-to-be-mentioned golden boy. \n\nAnd then there's Marcus Tullius Cicero, the great orator whose writings on republicanism would influence everyone from America's founding fathers to Edmund Burke. Cicero was technically an optimate, aligned with Sulla's conservative faction. But in his voluminous writings, Cicero repeatedly criticises Sulla's cruelty and lawlessness, even while supporting some of his institutional reforms. In his \"Pro Roscio Amerino\" speech, delivered just a few years after Sulla's death, Cicero boldly defended Sextus Roscius, a man whose father had been proscribed, explicitly condemning the corruption and injustice of the proscriptions. This is pretty much a clear a signal you could get that even conservatives understood that Sulla's methods had been morally indefensible. \n\nBut perhaps the most damning rejection came from one Gaius Julius Caesar himself – who Sulla had nearly killed during the proscriptions, saved only by the intervention of well-connected relatives and the Vestal Virgins (think Nuns that maintain a token and pact of God's own divine blessing to the state as symbolic safe haven of the citizenry). Caesar's family was connected to Marius, and the young Caesar had refused Sulla's demand to divorce his wife (whose family had opposed Sulla). He chose exile over compliance. When Caesar eventually gained power after his own civil war with Pompey, he deliberately positioned himself as the anti-Sulla. Where Sulla had been merciless, Caesar emphasised clementia (clemency) toward defeated enemies. Where Sulla had executed senators by the dozen, Caesar pardoned his opponents and even appointed them to government positions. Where Sulla had enriched himself through confiscations, Caesar implemented debt relief that benefited ordinary citizens. \n\nCaesar's famous clemency wasn't just moral posturing, but it was a strategic repudiation of the Sullan approach. Caesar understood that purges created generations of embittered enemies with legitimate grievances. His approach was to reconcile with opponents rather than eliminate them, to heal divisions rather than deepen them... while pulling leverage over his former foes via gratitude of still being alive. \n\nThe only property seizures Caesar was known for publicly were related to debt relief and paying off his campaign-related electoral debts. He gave sacrifices to thank the Vestal Virgins who'd saved him from Sulla's proscription list, recognizing how close he'd come to being one of Sulla's victims. \n\nEven when Caesar was declared dictator perpetuo (dictator for life), he carefully avoided the kind of bloody purges that had defined Sulla's reign. The message was clear: Sulla's methods were a failed experiment. Even those who shared his policy goals understood that his approach had been so toxic, so fundamentally destructive to the social fabric, that it needed to be explicitly rejected even among ideological allies. \n\nWhether you argue that Caesar was a better person than Sulla is up to you – but he was a better politician. He understood that sustainable power requires legitimacy, not just force. He grasped that even with a loyal army at his back, he needed to maintain at least the appearance of constitutional continuity and respect for tradition. Cruelty wasn't just immoral – it was strategically stupid. This lesson about the strategic value of clemency was apparently lost on later would-be strongmen. \n\nAfter Julius Caesar went to Pompey's theater for the last time and NOT enjoying the show there, his murderers claimed to be defending the Republic against tyranny. But the Roman people weren't buying it. They had experienced both Sulla's brutality and Caesar's clemency, and they overwhelmingly preferred the latter. The assassins' claim to be \"liberating\" Rome fell flat because most Romans didn't feel oppressed under Caesar – at least not compared to the chaotic violence of the preceding decades. \n\n\\---------------------- \n\nFast forward a little while later, and we arrive at a moment that perfectly illustrates how toxic was Sulla's example. \n\nThree men – Octavian (Caesar's adopted son), Marcus Antonius (Caesar's right-hand man), and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (professional political cockroach) – formed the Second Triumvirate to hunt down Caesar's killers and consolidate power. \n\nAnd the best thing they could figure out? Implement their own proscriptions. They drew up hit lists and unleashed another wave of state-sanctioned murder, starting with the execution of Cicero, whose hands and head were displayed in the Forum, as a trophy for Antonius, who Cicero criticized in his Philippics. \n\nThis decision would prove disastrous not just for their victims, but for the triumvirs' own legitimacy. One remarkable episode illustrates just how badly they fucked up. \n\nWhen the triumvirs decided to tax 1,400 wealthy women to fund their military campaigns, a woman named Hortensia – daughter of the famous orator Hortensius and from a staunchly optimate, aka conservative aristocratic family, did something unprecedented. \n\nTo appreciate how extraordinary this is, you need to grasp the social norms of Roman society. Patrician women, especially from conservative families, were expected to remain in the domestic sphere and exemplify modesty and propriety. The Forum was a male space, and women were to enter only accompanied. The rostra was for elected officials. A woman speaking publicly on political matters was simply not done. \n\nSo what did she do? She marched to the Forum with a group of elite women, pushed past the guards, stood on the rostra (the speakers' platform traditionally reserved for magistrates - males), and delivered a blistering speech condemning the triumvirs to their faces, while Cicero's hands were probably still a decorative ornament on said rostra and his skull was getting a nice sun-tan. So here was Hortensia, breaking every social convention, standing where Tribunes of the Plebes traditionally defended plebeian rights, using populist rhetoric to challenge the triumvirs' authority. \n\nIt wasn't just female empowerment (though it was certainly that in the modern consciousness) – it was a symptom of how thoroughly the triumvirs had ruptured the social contract. When conservative patrician women are adopting the tactics and language of populist rebellion, your \"restoration\" is completely fucked. It was a situation where a patrician matron had been pushed to the rhetoric of the populares and plebeians... against the Triumvirs. \n\nHortensia's protest was smoke for a potential society-wide revolt and revealed the fragility of their position – military might couldn't compensate for their fundamental lack of moral authority. Otherwise, they'd be nothing but warlords made up of ambitious opportunistic soldier-looters, no different from how they perceived barbarians, no different from the Tarquinii that were cast out and the reason Rome was a republic in the first place. \n\nMost tellingly, the triumvirs couldn't even shut her down. Despite having declared martial law and being at the height of their power in Rome, they were forced to reduce their demands. And the triumvirs themselves quickly realized their mistake - their proscriptions backfired spectacularly. Rather than consolidating their power, they created an atmosphere of terror that undermined public support. \n\nOctavian, the most politically astute of the three, began distancing himself from the proscriptions almost immediately. By the time he defeated Antony and became Augustus, father of the nation, first among equals and restorer of the \"Republic\" and establisher of the Roman Peace, he had completed a remarkable PR transformation. The man who was there when Cicero's death warrant was signed now presented himself as a restorer of peace and traditional values, cleverly pinning responsibility for the worst excesses on Antony and Lepidus. \n\nAugustus understood what Elon Musk apparently doesn't: Sulla's methods created short-term victories but long-term political liabilities. His entire imperial project was built around maintaining the forms of the Republic while changing its substance – a tacit acknowledgment that even with absolute power, openly emulating Sulla was political poison. \n\n\\--------------------------------- \n\nSo what does this ancient history lesson have to do with Elon Musk's tweets? \n\nEverything. \n\nWhen Musk casually suggests that \"perhaps we just need a modern day Sulla,\" he's not making an innocent historical reference. He's revealing either a profound misunderstanding of Sulla's historical significance or, worse, an actual endorsement of his methods. It's not governance, but state-sanctioned political terrorism in a toga. \n\nWhat's particularly ironic is that Musk's other tweet – \"The proscriptions of Marius forced the proscriptions of Sulla\" – reveals an even deeper ignorance. He's essentially regurgitating Sulla's own justification for his atrocities: that they were necessary responses to the actions of his enemies. This is exactly the logic that drives escalating cycles of political violence – \"they started it!\" is the eternal cry of the playground bully and the authoritarian alike. It's the justification that every faction use to excuse their own excesses. Forget how Nations Fail, it's how they die on a systematic, moral and societal level. \n\nWhat Musk fails to understand – or deliberately ignores – is that this logic was rejected by the Romans themselves. Caesar, who had every reason to hate Sulla and his supporters and had every inch of his equivalent power, if not even moreso, explicitly rejected this approach. He understood that cycles of retribution eventually consume everyone, that \"they made me do it\" is the weakest possible moral stance. \n\n\\-------------------- \n\nHistory is not just a collection of names and dates – it's a reservoir of human experience and governance models, a record of what works and what fails catastrophically despite values and age. When we invoke historical figures, we're not just displaying our knowledge; we're signaling our values and our understanding of how societies function. \n\nBy identifying with Sulla, Musk isn't just displaying historical ignorance – he's writing an ideological suicide note. By positioning himself as a Sulla fanboy – or cheering on others who might play that role – Musk is unwittingly predicting the failure of his own ideological project. The Romans themselves delivered the clearest verdict on Sulla's methods: they failed catastrophically. Not just morally, but practically. \n\nAt the heart of Musk's Sulla admiration – and similar thinking on parts of the right – is the Silicon Valley delusion that governance is primarily a problem of efficiency rather than legitimacy. Sulla's brutal efficiency did indeed solve some immediate problems. He eliminated his enemies, pushed through his legislative agenda, and restructured Roman institutions according to his vision. By pure efficiency metrics, his dictatorship was a success. \n\nBut his \"solutions\" failed the legitimacy test. They were perceived as so fundamentally unjust, so contrary to Roman values, that even his allies couldn't defend them. His reforms were dismantled not because they were inefficient, but because they lacked sustainable legitimacy. \n\nThis is the central delusion of modern Sulla admirers – they imagine that force and efficiency can substitute for consent and legitimacy. They fail to understand that sustainable governance requires both. \n\nIt also means that he either doesn't actually know Roman history beyond surface-level factoids, or knows the history but hasn't grasped its lessons, or understands perfectly well but is comfortable with political violence and autocracy. If Musk genuinely understands Sulla's history and still admires him, he's effectively saying: \"I think we should have a leader who marches troops on the capital, murders political opponents, confiscates their property, and dismantles democratic institutions – all while claiming to restore and preserve those institutions.\" \n\n When modern American political figures invoke Sulla – explicitly or implicitly – they're not just showing historical ignorance. They're revealing a fundamental misunderstanding of the constitutional system they claim to be defending. They're essentially saying, \"My ideas are so toxic that even my natural allies will eventually disavow them. My methods are so extreme that they'll discredit my goals. My understanding of power is so simplistic that I'll create more enemies than friends.\" \n\nFor countries like the United States that pride themselves on constitutional governance and democratic institutions with its explicit constitutional structure and separation of powers, Sulla worship is therefore an ideological suicide note. \n\nSulla-style \"solutions\" aren't just morally repugnant – they're institutionally suicidal. \n\nSo what's the takeaway from all this ancient history and billionaire tweet analysis? \n\nChoose your historical heroes carefully. They reveal more about your political values and vision than you might realize. They're telling you exactly what kind of governance they envision.\n\nAnd if you find yourself thinking \"perhaps we just need a modern day Sulla,\" do yourself a favour and crack open a history book to see how version 1.0's legacy fared.\n\n***TL:DR - MUSK IS A FUCKING MORON.*** ",

        "selftext": "I’ve been following the party since 2016, 2 years before I was able to vote. I’ve seen division growing and I’d really hate to see the end of the party. I’ve spent a great deal of time thinking of a solution and here’s where I’ve landed. \n\nThe answer is re-evaluating what libertarianism should mean in this country. If I were to isolate the values of true libertarianism, it would have to be: free markets, peace, consent, individual freedom, and natural rights. By all angles, this means becoming a big tent party, not just one narrowly defined by just paleos, minarchists, prags, and self declared ancaps; but one that accepts anybody liberal-minded under the freed market libertarian/anarchist umbrella (classical liberals, mutualists, individualists, agorists, voluntaryists, libertarian moderates/prags, ancaps, minarchists, bleeding hearts, left-market anarchists, pro gun liberals, liberty minded republicans [a dying breed], and anything in between that will act in good faith). The way I see it, moderating the message of the platform is a must. I don’t mean giving points to paleos or socialist, I mean making a point to unify the party under principles that are true to all market libertarians. \n\nThe first step is changing the party and platform to reflect language that is strictly “freedom and peace for all” rather than “liberty for me, but not for thee”. That means:\n\n1.\t⁠bringing back the anti racist plank with the addition of excluding people in support of ethonationalism, dehumanization, enforced theocracy, and feudalism from the party.\n\n2.\t⁠Adopting a mutual aid plank that supports mutual aid networks\n\n3.\t⁠Adopt a plank that identifies the free market as the peaceful exchange of goods, services, and concepts between voluntary parties via whichever contractual agreement they unanimously decide on (this clarifies that true freed markets are not just capitalism, but also open to barter, negotiation, gift economies, trade, and alternative currencies)\n\n4.\t⁠Endorse intentional communities and alternative legal systems including polycentric law, mutual arbitration systems, and dispute resolution based in restorative justice.\n\n5.\t⁠Explicitly reject corporate power and corruption.\n\n6.\t⁠Ensure the platform supports free movement and will not tolerate xenophobia or closed border policies.\n\nThese changes are what I see as necessary to prevent the party from falling to illiberal people and paleos ever again. This also opens the doors to libertarians that have long been hesitant to join the party and an opportunity for The U.S Liberal Party and others to merge with the LP.\n\nThe next step is democratizing and better federalization of how the party is run:\n\n1.\t⁠State parties need to be more compliant with the LNC.\n\n2.\t⁠Change membership rules to whoever agrees to the NAP and owns a lifetime membership while also offering membership for people who enlist for regular donations (options for monthly, weekly, or quarterly) to the party. Also National membership should automatically mean membership into their state party. This change gives more power to the individual members.\n\n3.\t⁠Absolve certain authority given to the chair to the rest of the LNC, ensuring mutual responsibility and that no chair should rule like a king (@ Angela).\n\n4.   Establish a behavioral code of conduct for the LNC and elected officials with STRICT enforcement. This must require mutual respect, talking in turn, no insults or direct attacks, no exploitation or embezzlement, honesty, and a desire to find solutions through consensus and common ground.\n\n5.\t⁠This is a big one: conjure a plan between the LP National and State Parties to create a local chapter in every county and/or major city within the next 10 years. This may mean members will have to double up responsibilities between their state and local affiliates in the short term, but the goal is to create a presence in people’s communities, which will increase recognition and participation in the party. When candidates and members have a better idea the issues their towns care about and of how to make a positive impact to their community, they have more influence in that area and can win elections. Imagine small groups of libertarians holding teach-ins, advocating direct action over local issues, holding monthly events (something like the really really free market fair comes to mind), holding charity drives, and sponsoring other local events.\n\n6.\t⁠Binding primaries for federal elections. The duopoly does this in pretty much every state and it makes sense. Registered Libertarians should have more of a say on how the party is run and who gets to represent us. You can claim it’d be too expensive to do, but we wouldn’t necessarily need state government approval, it can be done at state conventions to save money, and once we have plan #5 in the works, it’d be easier to achieve.\n\n7.\t⁠More transparency from the LNC\n\n8.\t⁠Treat libertarian media companies and think tanks as the fifth column of the LP. There is an odd hostility from some towards organizations like Reason, Cato, and others that makes zero sense to me. We’re on the same side and can achieve new heights with more cooperation. The rebooted archimedes project may solve some of this, but I would say it doesn’t go far enough.\n\nThanks for listening to my Ted talk",

Capitalism is \"the peaceful exchange of goods, services, and concepts between voluntary parties via whichever contractual agreement they unanimously decide on\"\n\n&gt; 4.\t⁠Endorse intentional communities and alternative legal systems including polycentric law, mutual arbitration systems, and dispute resolution based in restorative justice.\n\nThis is good, I would support this.\n\n&gt; 5.\t⁠Explicitly reject corporate power and corruption.\n\nThis contradicts #3. Corporations are voluntary contractual agreements. We are already in favor of getting rid of their state protections if that's what you are trying to say.\n\n&gt; 6.\t⁠Ensure the platform supports free movement and will not tolerate xenophobia or closed border policies.\n\nI disagree with the premise of this in favor of freedom of association. It's not that I think we shouldn't have free movement past government borders, I don't think governments can have borders because governments can't own property, but all property has borders and its owners do not need to allow anyone on their property. Libertarianism enables some level of xenophobia because we believe in freedom of association.\n\n&gt; to prevent the party from falling to illiberal people and paleos ever again.\n\nLibertarianism is not liberalism. These are very different, distinct concepts. Forcing libertarians to adopt liberalism is anti-libertarian.\n\n&gt; This also opens the doors to libertarians that have long been hesitant to join the party and an opportunity for The U.S Liberal Party and others to merge with the LP.\n\nWe do not want this, these people don't belong because they are *not* libertarian. It's not an issue that they are liberals, it's an issue that they are not libertarian. That is why they *left*, and that's a good thing.\n\n&gt; 1.\t⁠State parties need to be more compliant with the LNC.\n\nNo, that's not how this works for any party. The state parties are autonomos organizations, the LNC has zero say on what they do just like the RNC has zero say on what GOP Texas does.\n\n&gt; 2.\t⁠Change membership rules to whoever agrees to the NAP and owns a lifetime membership while also offering membership for people who enlist for regular donations (options for monthly, weekly, or quarterly) to the party.\n\nThis is already how this works.\n\n&gt; Also National membership should automatically mean membership into their state party. This change gives more power to the individual members.\n\nAgain, not how this works at all. These are distinct legal entities. This would kill the state parties, the states need to get their own money through their own membership.\n\n&gt; 3.\t⁠Absolve certain authority given to the chair to the rest of the LNC, ensuring mutual responsibility and that no chair should rule like a king (@ Angela).\n\nThis is already how it works and we have systems in place like the judicial committee. \n\n&gt; 4.   Establish a behavioral code of conduct for the LNC and elected officials with STRICT enforcement. \n\nA code of conduct is not a terrible idea.\n\n&gt; 5.\t⁠This is a big one: conjure a plan between the LP National and State Parties to create a local chapter in every county...\n\nThis is again, not dependent on LPNational. LPNational is not allowed to operate in the states, nor are they allowed to intervene in someone elses organization. They can *assist* those organizations by handing over their data, and helping offer resources, but anything else is outside of what they can do.\n\n&gt; 6.\t⁠Binding primaries for federal elections. The duopoly does this in pretty much every state and it makes sense. Registered Libertarians should have more of a say on how the party is run and who gets to represent us. You can claim it’d be too expensive to do, but we wouldn’t necessarily need state government approval, it can be done at state conventions to save money, and once we have plan #5 in the works, it’d be easier to achieve.\n\nI'm not sure what you are even asking for here, you already have a region representative that is elected at the national convention.\n\n&gt; 7.\t⁠More transparency from the LNC\n\nSure, I agree with this.\n\n&gt; 8.\t⁠Treat libertarian media companies and think tanks as the fifth column of the LP. There is an odd hostility from some towards organizations like Reason, Cato, and others that makes zero sense to me. We’re on the same side and can achieve new heights with more cooperation.

Some are good, some are bad, sometimes they are both.\n\n&gt; Thanks for listening to my Ted talk\n\nYou seem to have good intentions but I think your understanding of how political parties work is still very naive. My other comment would be that libertarianism and liberalism are very far from each other, libertarianism often can enable very illiberal beliefs and this is something that every libertarian needs to reconcile before continuing down their path.",

On to your other proposals!\n\n\\&gt; ⁠State parties need to be more compliant with the LNC.\n\nNo. It's a grassroots organization. The LNC runs the national convention, and only has very limited power over states with regard to that(setting delegation sizes, things like that). They don't run the state parties. The state parties run themselves, and mutually work together to set up national. You are advocating for an authoritarian, top down structure. That's not what the LP is. \n\n\\&gt; Also National membership should automatically mean membership into their state party. \n\nNo. Some people wish to support a state and not national or vice versa. That's their choice. \n\n\\&gt; Absolve certain authority given to the chair to the rest of the LNC\n\nYou're going to need to define this more than \"certain authority.\"\n\n\\&gt;Establish a behavioral code of conduct\n\nWhile decent conduct is desirable, I point out that these are inherently volunteer positions....and positions that usually require the volunteer spend a good bit of their own money. You can demand an infinite list of stuff for free, I suppose, but you will not get it. Codes of conduct generally work in settings where fiscal incentives exist to follow them, and that does not exist here. \n\n\\&gt; conjure a plan between the LP National and State Parties to create a local chapter in every county and/or major city within the next 10 years.\n\nWe don't have the volunteers. Asking existing volunteers to 'double up' is not a credible approach. Anyone already volunteering is generally already as busy as possible, as the LP has no shortage of work available. \n\nIf you wish to help out your state affiliate with a county, contact them. I'm sure they would love help. They are probably less enthused about non-volunteers who want to give a to-do list to the volunteers. \n\n\\&gt; Binding primaries for federal elections. The duopoly does this in pretty much every state and it makes sense. Registered Libertarians should have more of a say on how the party is run and who gets to represent us.

A state can bind delegates. That's up to your state. If you hold a vote at conventions, which we already do, that's not a primary. Primaries do, in fact, require state participation, and this is just not available in all states. Don't like state law in this regard? Join the club.

Moreover if they will have working racing and it will be funny I gladly will change my mind and recommend game to all friends/subscribers.",

        "selftext": "HI all,\n\nI have asked a similar question before and got a great response and insights which I appreciate (https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1jzq6bc/sase\\_vendors\\_shortlist/) so this is a more of a continuing/narrowing that post.\n\nOur focus has changed a bit as some of the comments and reflection on our business needs has led me to the fact we don't require SASE but purely SSE. So in response to that my question is do people still feel the same about their chosen vendor?\n\nThere was a lot of positives and love for Cato which is understandable, it is a brilliant platform. But I have also been lucky enough to try the Zscaler new UI console and feel the same. So given focus on SSE would you still stick with your suggestion even though SD-WAN is not in the cards?\n\nI've done my own research using my own data driven testing and research into the company and technologies (Gartner, GigaOm, Peer-spot) and have come to my own conclusion but I will leave that out to not sway results as I want opinion of practitioners who use it day to day or even consultants who sell  or support both.\n\nI'll make it simpler, if they cost the same and it was just SSE which would you go for and why, go in technical detail if you want to regarding differentiating capabilities.\n\nP.s. promise last question and opinion on this, I just find people on reddit better to give opinions of technologies like this\n\nThank you :)",

            "body": "Between the two, even though it won't likely come out as such with the Analysts you mentioned, Cato is the better solution IMO. Better overall security efficacy, better security strategy, faster to innovate and adapt to market changes (single code base) due to its architecture, full-service symmetry in all its PoPs, etc. \n\nZscaler is now fighting for its position at the SASE table, after having missed the MQ 2 years in a row. Think of what that does to divert engineering and R&amp;D efforts on the security side of the house. They operate multiple code bases and products which have a material impact on their speed of innovation and agility....and support. \n\nThat being said, the analysts are going to represent Zscaler as a more mature SSE solution in the market. I can think of 2 specific reasons why Cato's not really on anyone's SSE list:\n\n1. They sell too much SASE. Many of their customers (maybe most?) have their SD-WAN as well, so they are getting full stack SASE credit....which is why they are so high in the SASE MQ, GigaOm reports, Forest Waves, etc. True SSE, as the analysts count, does not include SD-WAN. That means Cato doesn't get SSE credit for all those SASE (which includes SSE) wins they have.\n\n2. From what I last heard, Cato didn't even register or respond to the SSE RFI/RFP from Gartner...maybe others? Hard to make the board if you're not even trying to get on it. Some think that SSE will eventually go away in favor of simply characterizing it all as SASE....another reason why Zscaler might be making so much effort and investment to get on the SASE board somewhere and why Cato probably doesn't care about spending the time and money to get on the SSE board. \n\nIn the end, SSE is a part of SASE. If you can deliver SASE, you can deliver SSE as well. If you're a leader in SASE, it would make logical sense to be an SSE leader as well...but logic doesn't always win with the analysts in the end.",

You get 3 IPs by default. Yes, Zscaler may be ahead on some CASB and DLP functions (from what I recall), I wouldn't bet against Cato getting there.\n\nOh, since you had ZPA in there, Cato's east/west is superior (private backbone and not proxy based).

            "body": "There are free market solutions to addressing climate change.  For starters it involves getting rid of government subsidies to fossil fuel providers that account for billions of dollars annually in corporate welfare to the most polluting of energy sources.  We also need to remove the roadblocks that are keeping us from building current models of safe, clean nuclear energy plants.  \n\nWithout government subsidies in the energy market there is price parity between energy sources instead of ridiculously cheap oil/coal.  Most folks these days prefer clean, renewable energy because of the environment and climate change so they would be more likely to vote with their pocket book and pick wind, solar, hydro, and nuclear over fossil fuels.\n\nRealistically though climate change isn't just a problem for the United States.  It's a global problem that the US isn't going to be able to solve alone.  Much of the pollution getting pumped into the earth's atmosphere now is from countries that are just going through their industrial revolution now.  I think we can solve more problems on a global level with free trade, friendship, and sharing ideas than we will with endless wars and regime change.  As a nation we've certainly made huge environmental mistakes in the past and we still continue to make some mistakes but overall the US does pretty OK.  Let's share with other nations our ideas and technology for being a successful industrial society without our skies and rivers looking like what China's got going on now.",

            "body": "Here is /r/garyjohnson's stance on the environment:\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\"The environment is a precious gift and must be protected. Governors Johnson and Weld believe strongly that the first responsibility of government is to protect citizens from those who would do them harm, whether it be a foreign aggressor, a criminal — or a bad actor who harms the environment upon which we all depend.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe need to stand firm to protect our environment for our future generations, especially those designated areas of protection like our National Parks. Consistent with that responsibility, the proper role of government is to enforce reasonable environmental protections. Governor Johnson did that as Governor, and would do so as President.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nGovernor Johnson believes the Environmental Protection Agency, when focused on its true mission, plays an important role in keeping the environment and citizens safe.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nJohnson does not, however, believe the government should be engaging in social and economic engineering for the purpose of creating winners and losers in what should be a robust free market.  Preventing a polluter from harming our water or air is one thing. Having politicians in Washington, D.C., acting on behalf of high powered lobbyists, determine the future of clean energy innovation is another.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn a healthy economy that allows the market to function unimpeded, consumers, innovators, and personal choices will do more to bring about environmental protection and restoration than will government regulations driven by special interests. Too often, when Washington, D.C. gets involved, the winners are those with the political clout to write the rules of the game, and the losers are the people and businesses actually trying to innovate.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen it comes to global climate change, Johnson and Weld believe that the politicians in Washington, D.C. are having the wrong debate.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIs the climate changing? Probably so.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIs man contributing to that change? Probably so.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut the critical question is whether the politicians’ efforts to regulate, tax and manipulate the private sector are cost-effective – or effective at all. The debate should be about how we can protect our resources and environment for future generations. Governors Johnson and Weld strongly believe that the federal government should prevent future harm by focusing on regulations that protect us from real harm, rather than needlessly costing American jobs and freedom in order to pursue a political agenda.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Protect the Environment. Promote Competition. Incentivize Innovation.**\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nhttps://www.johnsonweld.com/environment",

Mark Carney and Pierre Poilievre faced the critical glare of the mega-popular Radio-Canada talk show Tout le monde en parle on Sunday in an attempt to woo francophone viewers, with the Liberal leader being pressed on his cultural awareness of the province and his Conservative rival differentiating himself against perceptions in Quebec he is a \"mini-Trump.\" Despite those moments, the CBC Poll Tracker still has Carney far ahead of his rivals in Quebec, with the Liberals poised to receive 42.4 per cent of the popular vote, the Bloc and the Conservatives jockeying behind him at 23.5 and 23.2 per cent, respectively.\n\n[Liberal operatives](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberal-oppo-csfn-1.7509217) planted 'stop the steal' buttons at conservative conference. Liberal Party says campaigners 'regrettably got carried away' with use of buttons. Two Liberal Party staffers attended last week's Canada Strong and Free Networking (CSFN) Conference where they planted buttons that used Trump-style language and highlighted division within the Conservative Party.\n\nPoilievre says [he'll use notwithstanding clause](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/poilievre-notwithstanding-clause-multiple-murders-1.7509497) to ensure multiple-murderers die in prison. Carney and Singh condemn suggested use of notwithstanding clause. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre says he'll ensure multiple-murderers die in jail by becoming the first Canadian prime minister to override Charter rights by invoking the notwithstanding clause. People convicted of first-degree murder in Canada are ineligible for parole for 25 years. A sentencing provision introduced in 2011 by the Harper Conservatives gave judges discretion to hand out consecutive, 25-year blocks of parole ineligibility in cases where an offender has committed multiple first-degree murders. It means that if someone was convicted of six murders they would not be eligible for parole for 150 years.\n\n[McGill files injunction](https://www.ctvnews.ca/montreal/article/mcgill-files-injunction-against-pro-palestinian-student-group-following-protest/) against pro-Palestinian student group following protest. McGill University has filed an application for a provisional injunction against a pro-Palestinian student group, seeking to protect the rights of students and staff from threat, obstruction and harassment, according to the university. In a message sent to students and staff last week, McGill President and Vice-Chancellor Deep Saini said that the university was seeking the injunction against Students for Palestinian Honour and Resistance (SPHR) because of the group’s involvement in classroom obstruction and vandalism during a three-day student strike from April 2 to 4.\n\n**United States:**\n\n[US officials refuse to help](https://www.firstpost.com/world/us-officials-refuse-to-help-wrongfully-deported-man-return-from-el-salvador-13879702.html) wrongfully deported man return from El Salvador. The Trump administration has acknowledged that Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant who was living in Maryland and has had a work permit since 2019, was deported in March in violation of an immigration judge’s order blocking his removal to El Salvador. U.S. officials said in court filings on Sunday that they were not obligated to help a Maryland resident get out of prison in El Salvador after he was erroneously deported, despite a Supreme Court ruling directing the government to “facilitate” his return to the United States. Attorneys for the administration of President Donald Trump said the high court’s order to “facilitate” the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia meant they should “remove any domestic obstacles that would otherwise impede the alien’s ability to return here,” not help extract him from El Salvador.\n\nUS deports [10 more alleged gang members](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/13/us-deportations-el-salvador-marco-rubio) to El Salvador, says Rubio. Secretary of state says ‘criminals’ were taken to country thanks to alliance between Trump and Nayib Bukele. The US has deported another 10 people that it alleges are gang members to El Salvador, secretary of state Marco Rubio said on Sunday, a day before that country’s president is due to visit the White House. “Last night, another 10 criminals from the MS-13 and Tren de Aragua Foreign Terrorist Organizations arrived in El Salvador,” Rubio said in an X/Twitter post.\n\nImmigration attorney: ICE prosecutors have 'no idea' of deported maekup artists' status.

The man allegedly died after being detained in an ICE facility for months without treatment, raising alarms about systematic medical neglect amid expansion plans. A 45-year-old Ethiopian man died in U.S. immigration custody after spending months without treatment for HIV or tuberculosis, according to a new report from the Project on Government Oversight (POGO). His recent death is one of the latest to occur in the Eloy Detention Center in Arizona, a facility long flagged for detainee deaths and systemic medical neglect.\n\nTrump’s Department of Justice [deletes link to study](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/trump-doj-undocumented-migrants-crime-b2712619.html) showing undocumented immigrants commit less crime than US citizens. Administration has framed mass deportation operations as response to violent crime. The Trump administration appears to have deleted a Justice Department web page describing a study that concluded undocumented immigrants in Texas commit notably less crime than U.S. citizens, a finding that contradicts the White House’s frequent descriptions of such migrants as violent criminals. “Sometime in the last week, the DOJ removed this from its website,” immigration expert David Bier of the Cato Institute wrote on X. “Wonder why?”\n\nAn Emboldened Anti-Abortion Faction Wants Women Who Have Abortions To Face Criminal Charges. Many people involved in the abortion debate say a movement of so-called abortion abolitionists who want to punish women for having abortions is [widening.So](http://widening.So) far this year, bills introduced in at least 12 states – Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas – would allow prosecutors to charge those who have [abortions with homicide](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/us-abortion-abolitionists-criminalize-women_n_67fb1856e4b0bb4e0b77b81c). In some of those states, women could be subject to the death penalty if the bills were to become law. Most of those states already ban abortions in most cases, but the restrictions have typically penalized providers, rather than those seeking the procedure. This past week, Alabama lawmakers filed legislation that would consider abortion as murder. In Georgia last month, protesters massed at the Capitol to oppose legislation that would classify abortions from the point of fertilization as homicide. The bill had nearly two dozen Republican co-sponsors.\n\nSuspect arrested in arson fire that forced [Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro](https://apnews.com/article/josh-shapiro-arson-police-fire-pennsylvania-governor-2d17ec60c48f7d4d15123dda60c88699), family to flee residence. A man scaled an iron security fence in the middle of the night, eluded police and broke into the Pennsylvania governor’s mansion where he set a fire that left significant damage and forced Gov. Josh Shapiro, his family and guests to evacuate the building, authorities said Sunday. The man, captured later in the day, will face charges of attempted murder, terrorism, aggravated arson and aggravated assault, authorities said. Paris emphasized that the investigation is continuing. Authorities did not disclose the man’s motive, but an emotional Shapiro, who is viewed as a potential White House contender for the Democratic Party in 2028, said he is unbowed. Shapiro said that if Balmer was trying to stop him from doing his job, then he’ll work harder, and he added that Balmer will not stop him from observing his faith.\n\nDemocracy in the dark: [Ohio House secretly](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/democracy-in-the-dark-ohio-house-secretly-moves-to-eliminate-elected-coroners/ar-AA1CPsE3) moves to eliminate elected coroners. In a stunning example of government overreach conducted entirely in the shadows, the Ohio House has moved to eliminate elected coroners across the state – without a single public hearing or moment of debate, a Friday topic of discussion on the Today in Ohio podcast. Said host Chris Quinn: “This was an Ohio House move born in complete secrecy, without hearings or discussion. No one knew it was coming.” The provision, quietly inserted into the state budget instead of becoming a separate bill, would transition 86 counties from elected coroners to appointed ones, fundamentally altering a system that has existed for decades. Beyond the procedural concerns lies a substantive worry about political interference in what should be independent death investigations.\n\nThis Washington border county is desperate for Canadians. “There’s just no one around,” said a gas station owner in [Whatcom County](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/whatcom-county-washington-canadians-trump-boycotts-rcna198234), where the economy depends on residents of British Columbia remaining eager to buy American. Canadians frequently stop by Blaine, Washington, for gas, dairy and other staples that tend to be cheaper across the border. But the trade and diplomatic fight U.S. President Donald Trump has picked with America’s northern neighbor is causing more Canadians to stay home. Their boycotts have put business owners in Blaine and surrounding Whatcom County on edge, wondering how long the area’s economy can survive with fewer visitors from British Columbia to fuel it.\n\nJack Dorsey and Elon Musk would like to [‘delete all IP law’](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/13/jack-dorsey-and-elon-musk-would-like-to-delete-all-ip-law/). Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter (now X) and Square (now Block), sparked a weekend’s worth of debate around intellectual property, patents, and copyright, with a characteristically terse post declaring, “delete all IP law.” X’s current owner Elon Musk quickly replied, “I agree.” It’s not clear what exactly brought these comments on, but they come at a time when AI companies including OpenAI (which Musk co-founded, competes with, and is challenging in court) are facing numerous lawsuits alleging that they’ve violated copyright to train their models.\n\nTrump, top aides fuel [tariff confusion](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/13/trump-commerce-chief-says-not-like-a-permanent-sort-of-exemption-for-phones-computers.html) by questioning reciprocal exemptions. President Donald Trump and his top trade officials have suggested reciprocal tariff exemptions announced Saturday would be partially or completely reversed in coming weeks. “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook’ for the unfair Trade Balances, and Non Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other Countries have used against us, especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!” Trump wrote in a social media post. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also suggested that separate tariffs for electronic  products are “coming soon.”\n\nState superintendent says federal request to eliminate DEI programs appears ‘unlawful,’ [Wisconsin schools](https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2025/04/superintendent-says-federal-request-to-eliminate-dei-programs-appears-unlawful-wisconsin-schools-wont-comply) won’t comply.

Meanwhile, the country’s Finance Minister Shunichi Kato said that “the US and Japan share the view that excessive FX volatility is undesirable.” “FX rate to be determined by markets,” Kato noted further.

The leader of Hungary’s largest opposition party on Sunday told thousands of supporters that he would guide his country out of its international isolation if he defeats Prime Minister Viktor Orbán in elections scheduled for next year. Péter Magyar, the leader of the Respect and Freedom (Tisza) party, represents the most serious challenge to Orbán’s power since the right-wing populist leader took power in 2010. Recent polling suggests that Tisza has overtaken Orbán’s Fidesz party as Hungary struggles with a stagnating economy and has been politically sidelined in the European Union over Orbán’s policies.\n\nUK ‘will [never change food standards’](https://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe/article/3306360/uk-will-never-change-food-standards-any-trade-deal-us-says-government?module=top_story&amp;pgtype=homepage) in any trade deal with US, says government. US and Canadian practices like washing raw chicken in chlorinated water or feeding growth hormones to cattle are banned in the UK and EU. Britain will not relax its food safety standards as part of any deal to secure lower tariffs on its exports to the United States, business minister Jonathan Reynolds said on Sunday.",

        "selftext": "&gt; Every Negro leader is keenly aware, from direct and personal experience, that the segregationists make no fine distinctions between the Negro and the Jew. The irrational hatred motivating his actions is as readily turned against Catholic, Jew, Quaker, Liberal and One-Worlder, as it is against the Negro. Some have jeered at Jews with Negroes; some have bombed the homes and churches of Negroes; and in recent acts of inhuman barbarity, some have bombed your synagogues—indeed right here in Florida. Have the Nazis murdered Catholic Poles and Jews, Protestant Norwegian and Jews, the races of America fly blindly at both of us caring not at all which of us falls. There aim is to maintain through cruel segregation groups whose uses as scapegoats can facilitate their political and social rule over all people. Our common fight is against these deadly enemies of democracy, and our glory is that we are chosen to prove that courage is a characteristic of oppressed people, however cynically and brutally they are denied full equality and freedom. - Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., 1958\n\n.\n\n**INTENTION:**\n\n&gt; “Anti-Semitism is the socialism of fools.” - August Bebel, German Politician, leader of the Social Demo­crats in the late 19th century\n\nLet the intention of this be absolutely crystal clear, this is not an indictment of the Black community, it is a historic analysis of how false conceptions can be spread and reinforced through a community, both by lack of experience, cultural misunderstanding, and unfortunate encounters. Nothing discussed here is insurmountable, merely a highlighting of perceptions among some, or many, but absolutely not all black Americans. \n\nAt the end of the day Black Americans and Jewish Americans have been largely stalwart allies of one another, and have worked ceaselessly together for the efforts of Civil Rights. \n\nThese ideas presented within are a cancerous growth that has been allowed to develop in dusty corners of black culture, and needs to be opposed and spoken out against. \n\nFurthermore, Black American Antisemitism is vastly outnumbered by White Antisemitism. White people both outnumber, and have far more resources to work with in regards to radical networks in contrast to Black extremists. \n\nSo in no way is this intended to portray this as a problem of equal scope, merely discuss how it occurred.  \n\nEuropean-originated Antisemitism has it's own unique history, and would require it's own post, though understanding a basis for it would go far to explain how it influenced Black Antisemitism.\n\nAlso, the proclivities of extremist Black Americans, either in political or religious exploration, should in no way be something that hardens the heart of any person who believes in Justice for, or of the intense needs of the Black community, and our need to work together. On the contrary, this is very much about sections of the Black community needing *help*, they believe these things because of a great deal of pain, stress, or misfortune that has lead them on the hunt for scapegoats, in the same way that the Black community has received itself far too much scapegoating of it's own. This is a problem that needs to be fixed. \n\nI am going to summarize and collate much previous writing on the subject, I will drop extended reading and sources at the end. \n\n.\n\n**PRE-1920's:** \n\n&gt; \"All of us black people who lived in the neighborhood\n&gt; hated Jews, not because they exploited us but because we had been\n&gt; taught at home and in Sunday school that Jews were 'Christ killers.' To hold an attitude of antagonism or distrust toward Jews, was bred in us from childhood; it was not merely racial prejudice, it was part of our cultural heritage.\" - Richard Wright, \"Black Boy\", 1945.\n\nThe Origins of Black perceptions of Jewish people was not something that came solely out of their Migrational Collisions in the New World at the dawn of the 20th century. On the contrary Black Americans underwent centuries of exposure to and infection with European Antisemitic Folktales, LONG before there was any significant engagement between the two groups. \n\nProtestant beliefs in the 19th century were one of out-right hostility to Jewish people, with framing of them as \"Christ Killers\", and of infidels who have rejected the Christian Faith as common ones. These perceptions can be illustrated by folk songs and rhymes from the era such as:\n\n&gt; 'Bloody Christ Killer\n\n&gt; Never Trust a Jew\n\n&gt; Bloody Christ Killer\n\n&gt; What won't a Jew do?' \n\nAnother insight into Pre-20th century black opinions on Jews can be found in this 1859 quote from 'Harper's Magazine', from an interview with an escaped slave: \n\n&gt; \"I don't want to go to live with Miss Isaacs.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; \"Why don't you want to live with her? She is a good lady and will make you a\n&gt; kind mistress, and besides, you won't have any hard work to do.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; \"Ah! But Mass. . ., they tell me Miss Isaacs is a Jew; an' if the Jews kill the\n&gt; Lord and Master, what won't they do to a poor little n***er like me!\"\n\nJust the rumor that a new family was made up of Jews was enough to make this woman endanger her life and flee, knowing that the punishment could be severe, just because of her greater fear of Jews. \n\nAmong the other ideas that Black Americans absorbed through osmosis from European Protestantism were cultural and folk beliefs that painted Jews as sly and treacherous, beliefs that they were unscrupulous seekers of wealth and power, and beliefs about their position as \"Overlords\" who controlled finances and society. \n\nThis can be showcase by W.E.B. Du Bois early opinions, where he discussed Jews in very antisemitic terms, \"There is in them all that slyness, that lack of straight-forward openheartedness which goes straight against me.\", and another point in an earlier edition of \"Souls of Black Folk\", \n\n&gt; \"I have seen, in the Black Belt of Georgia, an ignorant honest Negro buy and pay\n&gt; for a farm in installments three separate times, and then in the face of law and\n&gt; decency the enterprising Russian Jew who sold it to him pocketed the money\n&gt; and deed and left the black man landless, to labor on his own land at thirty cents\n&gt; a day.\"\n\nThere were also plenty of pre-20's articles in black newspapers, where Jews are case in the light of \"money-grubber\" and as Folk that should not be trusted, such as this 1903 quote from \"Colored American\", \"...in an incredibly short time after the arrival of a Jew in any community he has nearly every family in his debt or under obligation to him.\"\n\nI feel it is suffice to say that Black Americans were not free from the cultural landscape they grew in, and cannot escape the prejudices that were shared by many Southern Whites and Protestantism at the time about Jewish peoples, and carried that with them before they ever met Jews in person.\n\n. \n\n**THE GREAT MIGRATIONS:**\n\n&gt; \"Just as society must have a scapegoat, so hatred must have a symbol. Georgia has the Negro and Harlem has the Jew.\" - James Baldwin, 1948.\n\nFollowing the growth of Jim Crow laws, and the failures of fighting them following Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), alongside with widespread violence and lynchings, over 3,400 were murdered in Lynchings from 1882-1968; more were absolutely killed before definitive records began to be kept by the Chicago Tribune in 1882, the peak year was 1892 with over 200 cases. \n\nAlmost simultaneously there was another group undergoing similar struggles; between 1880-1920 there were over 1,300 Anti-Jewish Pogroms and mass-violence events in Eastern Europe, resulting in between 70,000  to 250,000 deaths, and half a million homeless. \n\nDuring this time Southern Black Americans began en masse to move to Northern Industrial Centers such as Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, Detroit, Cleveland, and Baltimore, which only accelerated with the commencement of WWI, and the need for an increase in industrial production, at the same time that Jews also fleeing violence flooded into the same Industrial Centers hungry for work, and a respite from violence. \n\nThis lead to the first major interactions between Black Americans and Jewish Americans, with both the good and bad that can come from both closer relations, and misunderstandings and conflict. \n\nMany Jewish Newspapers did not mince words, calling Anti-Black violence in the south, just what they were, Pogroms. W.E.B. Du Bois overcoming his earlier prejudices against Jews joined with several Jews to found the NAACP. Then Jews and Black leaders worked together again and founded The Urban League. Booker T. Washington and Julius Rosenwald worked together to improve Black Education access in the South. Many Black and Jewish leaders saw clear parallels between the Jewish experience of being a people without a home, and the Black American experience of being taken out of theirs and likewise made nomadic. \n\nAt the same time, things were not so glorious and beautiful. Jewish people are not free of bias, especially group who are naturally insular and faced generational trauma, and often being immigrants with a cultural and language divide between them and Black Americans, many Jews also hungry to assimilate to reduce the threat of violence against them often adopted the racist trappings of American Culture at the time, which contributed to many Jews bigoted perceptions of Black Americans. \n\nLikewise, as previously mentioned Black Americans did not spend the last few centuries in isolation, they spent it learning the bigoted perceptions of Europeans and Americans towards Jews, and the perceptions that came with that. \n\nWhen Blacks fled to major urban centers they often had a limited support network and few resources, even if they often were still dealing with a system that was biased against their growth and ownership of property. \n\nWhen Jews fled, they often brought with them their Community religious institutions, fraternal associations, families, and resources, not to mention the small Jewish community already in the United States that was often insistent for new Jewish immigrants to assimilate as quickly as possible to reduce the potential for Antisemitism, or for Jews to be seen as \"Others\". \n\nWhich often contributed to a landlord-renter power dynamic developing between Jews who often could pull together resources to buy property and open shops, and Black Americans who often could not. This relationship, with Jews often being one of the main groups who would rent to and sell in black majority neighborhoods, led to claims that they were treating Blacks unfairly, often with additional \"Negro Taxes\" in the words of Dr. King: \n\n&gt; \"When we were working in Chicago, we had numerous rent strikes on the West Side, and it was unfortunately true that, in most instances, the persons we had to conduct these strikes against were Jewish landlords... We were living in a slum apartment owned by a Jew and a number of others, and we had to have a rent strike. We were paying $94 for four run-down, shabby rooms, and .... we discovered that whites ... were paying only $78 a month. We were paying 20 percent tax. The Negro ends up paying a color tax, and this has happened in instances where Negroes actually confronted Jews as the landlord or the storekeeper.\"\n\nIn many ways Jews were both simultaneously, \"white\" but enough on the periphery of mainstream society that criticism of Jews could be stated openly in a way that criticism of the larger White society couldn't be, how many Jews saw the criticism were in these terms, \"The Negro, filled with hidden resentment because of the inferior status forced upon him and not daring to express it in open anti-white terms, can find an outlet through his attitude toward a group that in one sense belongs to the dominant white majority, and at the same time does not completely belong, and therefore can be the target of hatred without inviting the wrath of the community as a whole… to the Negro [the Jew] becomes a symbol of general economic discrimination and injustice.”, a Rabbinical Student named Louis Silberman was quoted as saying. \n\nThis set the cultural groundwork for the period where many figures in Black Thought, and many leaders of the Civil Rights Movement, and of Black Cultural and Religious organizations would be born. Malcolm X, 1925, Martin Luther King Jr., 1929, Louis Farrakhan, 1933, John Lewis, 1940, Jesse Jackson, 1941, Al Sharpton, 1954. \n\nMost of the people who would gain prominence during or after the Civil Rights movement, grew up largely in this culture of on one hands Jews assisting with Civil Rights, and animosity between your average Jewish and Black American. \n\n.\n\n**POST-WAR &amp; THE CIVIL RIGHTS ERA:**\n\n&gt; There are Hitlers loose in America today, both in high and low places. As the tensions and bewilderment of economic broblems become more severe, history scapegoats, the Jews, will be joined by new scapegoats, the Negroes. The Hitlers will seek to divert people’s minds and turn their frustrations and anger to the helpless, to the outnumbered. Then whether the Negro and Jew shall live in peace will depend upon how firmly they resist, how effectively they reach the minds of the decent Americans to halt this deadly diversion. - Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., 1958\n\nFollowing the horrors of the WWII and the Holocaust, for a time there was nadir of Antisemitism, Jews were accelerating their assimilating following mass Jewish service during the War, and the sympathies of many people who were once casual bigots were tempered by either their experiences in, or news of the war and the horrors it brought. \n\nFor Black people though, many in the community began to see Jewish assistance as often \"patronizing\", and they wanted to feel like they had a greater ownership and control over their movement, especially as Jews began to see greater mainstream acceptance.\n\nAdditional Jewish-Black divides began forming along other areas such as Vietnam (Jews largely agreed with American goals of fighting Communism and interventionism; while Blacks often aligned with Anti-War sentiments), Affirmative Action (Jews were afraid of being sidelined with quotas, having to compete for fewer options against White applicants who they were often afraid would get preference; Blacks were largely in support of balancing out inequality), the expanding economic divide between Jews and Blacks (Jews were moving up economically; Blacks were staying stagnant), the development of Israel from Underdog to Dominate military force in the 60's-70's, with Jews largely continuing to support, while many in the Peace Movement seeing Israel as just another Western Colonial Power, and then the expansion of Antisemitic rhetoric by leaders such as Farrakhan. \n\nThese divisions heightened when Black Power and Black Separatism began to grow in popularity, especially with the Nation of Islam's meeting with George Lincoln Rockwell in 1962. Pro-Separatist radicals on the fringed would continue parroting claims that Desegregation was a \"Jewish\" plot, most likely through osmosis of these ideas from White Separatists. \n\nApart from the radical fringes though, Jews still played a significant role in the Civil Rights movement, and died alongside their Black allies, such as in the Mississippi Burning Murders, where Three social workers, two Jewish, and one Black, were murdered together in Meridian, MS. \n\nThe importance of the cooperation and work during this era should in no way be understated, it was drastically important, but more and more divisions had began forming between the communities, which was only accelerated by Jewish economic and geographic move away from black communites.\n\n.\n\n**THE MODERN ERA:**\n\n\t\n&gt; \"Once again, sons and daughters of slavery and Holocaust survivors are bound together with a shared agenda, bound by their hopes and their fears.\" - Jesse Jackson\n\nSo that now brings us to the last 30 years, with decades of greater geographic and economic separation between the groups. \n\nThe Early-90's were a very bleak time in regards to the Black-Jewish Relationship, with several major events in the communities happening all at once. \n\nIn 1991 the Crown Heights Riots occurred, after an accident where a car driven by a Hasidic man got into an accident and popped a curb and struck two Black Children, one child, Gavin Cato, died, while his Cousin Angela was severely injured, rumors spread among the neighborhood about the response of local authorities and of a Jewish ambulance service. Angry people took to the streets and damaged Jewish homes and storefronts, and attacked Jewish people on the streets, eventually leading to the murder of Yankel Rosenbaum, a Jewish student, by a mob of people reportedly heard saying, \"Kill The Jews\", and the murder a few weeks after the riots of Italian businessman Anthony Graziosi, passing through the neighborhood, who reportedly was confused for a Hasidic Jew. \n\nAt the end of the riot 1 civilian was murdered, 38 civilians were injured, 152 police officers were injured, 225 cases of robbery and burglary, 27 vehicles were destroyed, and seven stores were looted or burned, and there were nearly 130 arrests. \n\nAt the Eulogy for Gavin, Al Sharpton spoke, and made references to \"Diamond Dealers\", and a sign was raised which read, \"Hitler did not do the job\". \n\nThe same year, Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam released, \"The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews\", which claimed various conspiracy theories, such as Jews being the primary motivators behind the Transatlantic Slave Trade both in inventing and starting it, and in financing and maintaining it, that they had taken over finance, textiles, and cotton and thus built slavery to support it, started the KKK, that they have purposefully tried to take over and control Black Americans, and that Jews murdered Leo Frank as a ploy for sympathy and to work their way into Black communities, among other claims. \n\nThe Tome can politely be described as not passing any kind of historic muster, and has been repeatedly debunked, but it's popularity among fringe Black Militant elements continues, with both White and Black Nationalists having long adopted many of the books claims as talking points, and continue to support and signal boost them among Antisemitic Twitter even today. \n\nBy the mid-90's with the Million Man March, Farrakhan continued to serve a major role in organizing and speaking to the hearts of Black Americans, much to the chagrin of many in the Black Community, who continued to see his prominence as showcasing the lack of good Black leaders. \n\nBy 1998, a ADL survey found that Black Americans were one of the groups with the highest levels of Antisemitism, but that it was going down over time. \n\nFast-Forwarding to 2020, we are now in the heart of a rapid escalation in Antisemitism over the last 5 years where we have now hit a 40 year high, with every kind of Antisemitic hate crime increasing, Social Media has become incredibly more useful in it's ability to signal boost and recruit and radicalize, and we have dealt with a Major Antisemitic act of mass violence for the last two years. \n\nSo where are we now? What are the solutions? \n\nFirst of all, lets look at what happened AFTER the Crown Heights Riot... \n\n10 years after, a street fair was held, where the families of Cato and Rosenbaum exchanged symbolic gifts, and made statements about the need to heal. The City had been undertaking outreach programs for years, pointing to what Jews and Black have accomplished together. Al Sharpton has apologized and was told by Coretta Scott King, \"Sometimes you are tempted to speak to the applause of the crowd rather than the heights of the cause, and you will say cheap things to get cheap applause rather than do high things to raise the nation higher.\" \n\nThe Demographics of the neighborhood in 1991 is largely the same, with the Jewish community choosing to stay. \n\nHealing after what feels like a betrayal is hard, deeply so, and when we hear a group that we automatically assume is supposed to be an \"ally\" say or allow something hateful to happen, our automatic impulse might be to react with anger, or even violence, embrace them in the death spiral. \n\nI argue that nothing is insurmountable, EVERY single thing I mentioned is a symptom of pain, alienation, misguided rage, and have *solutions*. Addressing the pain that allows these things to grow uncontrolled is essential to salting the earth that allowed them to burst forth in the first place, and of undoing that horrors that we have done by letting nightmarish lies of bigotry and prejudice continue to be passed down to our children. \n\nI would love to open up the thread for discussion, and anyone that has anything to add to the discussion, or want to bring up some things that were missed, please bring them up. \n\n.\n\n**CITATIONS**\n\n\"From Swastika to Jim Crow\".

            "body": "This is a great post. One thing you alluded to, but deserves more expansion, in my opinion, is the effect that cold war politics, specifically around the 70's, may have played in the split. For many Jews, the United States was a dream come true, having escaped from the ahnd of the Nazis. The aftermath of the Holocaust meant that anti-semtism became less prevalent, and it had always been relatively good for Jews. The US came to represent all that was good in the world for many Jews. (This is also relavant to a split that exists beteen Israeli Jews. To simplify, both took somewhat different lesssons from the Holocaust, with Israeli Jews emphasizing the need for strength and no surrender, and American Jews emphasizing the ideals of equaility and democracy, ideals they learned from America.)  The strong US support of Israel also played into this full buy in to America. The USSR on the other hand was viewed by many Jews as being the opposite, a great evil. They knew the struggle of Jews there to maintain their way of life and most Jews would participate to some extent in the protests against the USSR on behalf of refusniks. (This also aided in the popularity of Kahane, a Jewish extremist.) The Soviet Union also was much more anti-Israel. So many Jews were extremely anti-Soviet, and supported cold war actions, like Vietnam. For black Americans, it was different. The US engaged in discrimination against them and denied them access to the American dream. The Soviets didn't really represent a threat to them, and they viewed it more positively as the Soviets didn't really dscriminate against them. They viewed a lot of the wars as unnecessary wastes of life. The Jews also were turning more right wing at this time, even if they overall voted Democratic. https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jewish-voting-record-in-u-s-presidential-elections\n\n\n\nFull disclaimer: I'm Jewish, which is why I foucused more on the Jewish community here.

It's still part of their identities through the traditions in their families, even if it's not as visible relative to their broader participation in whiteness, and even if it tends to come out at weird times and be expressed in weird ways (as this stuff always is).\n\nBut that this sort of latter-day hatred of the U.S.S.R. feels very different from and not to be confused with the proper \"Cold War\" hatred of the U.S.S.R. for being socialist - and perhaps the broader participation of these former refugee groups in postwar prosperity and cultural assimilation created the second-wave of anti-Soviet sentiment that led to the rise of John Paul II helped propel Reagan to office.\n\nAnd I wouldn't blame Black people at all for not feeling connected to that sentiment for even a little bit, any more than I would particularly expect white people whose families have been here for 400 years to really connect with *An American Tail*. If you didn't come to the U.S. in order to flee a place that was worse, and in fact might prefer to leave it for a place that would treat you better if such an option existed, why would the relative tolerance of the U.S. over the U.S.S.R. for Jews, for example, resonate with you as a concern?",

The blind irony of the self-centeredness of that position sometimes takes my breath away. The base prevalence of it across all human communities is just so huge - it is less that specific economic conditions produce racial, ethnic and religious hostility, and more that the human mind and human socialization are so geared toward racial, ethnic and religious hostility in some underlying general function that the question is not whether it exists, but how.\n\nIt's undeniable that specific circumstances in the movement of people, in the labor force, in social and economic  organization of communities shape and inform the salient divisions and the nature of this kind of hostility -- but they don't explain its presence vs. its absence.\n\nThe base assumption should be that it will exist. It should not be shocking or ignored or justified that it also exists in subaltern populations.\n\nAnd it's terrifying how eager Americans today are to embrace antisemitism specifically, because we know from even recent experience that even if we can't prevent people entirely from being tribal, and instead ought to attempt to structure incentives and responsibly administer and lead institutions to blunt the harsher effects of tribalism and create constructive and amicable engagement even among groups that see each other as different, we know that the shape of antisemitism - the how of it, the legacy, the echo of it that keeps being recapitulated through the self-reinforcing cultural cycles of the social organizations that initially produced it - is, even among prejudices, extremely dangerous to any sense of the moral good or to the aggregate degree of human suffering.",

I am currently working with a customer that uses Cato for DNS on all their server VMs. Currently, they do not have a DNS entry on any of their VMs pointed to an internal DNS service/domain controller at all. All VMs point to their Cato IP for primary DNS entry, and the secondary points to 8.8.8.8. *(DNS is not my forte, and I am no Cato expert, so I can't speak to whether this is a good/recommended practice or not, but it is what they currently have in place. If this is not a proper practice, I am open to learning why and what alternative should be in place.)*\n\nIf you're familiar with how Data Labs work, then you'll see why this presents a major issue when trying to leverage VRO and the Data Lab for sandboxed DR testing. Which prompts my question: Has anyone ever had to perform sweeping DNS changes to the VMs being powered on in a Data Lab sandbox?\n\nWithout DNS pointing to something usable, we can't authenticate to run custom scripts, or to process logins to the sandboxed VMs. I can't use the the DNS options in the Data Lab networking settings becuass the are only applicable if using DHCP - all these VMs are static IP'd. So, what other ways are there to script or programmatically change DNS on the VMs? Is there any way for this to happen? Scripting it with powershell won't work because we can't authenticate to the admin$ share to run the scrip...ask me how i know. (*No...we didn't think it through before we tried.*) My gut tells me that each production VM needs to have a tertiary (*and possibly quaternary*) DNS entry poionting to the domain controller(s) we will use in the lab and then everything will 'just work', albeit with some delays while the servers figure out DNS in the lab... \n\nAre there any other options? Help me reddit hivemind, you're my only hope.\n\n",

I am using VRO and do have DNS changes that are made to work both inside the sandbox, and in the even we actually have to failover to DR.  \n\nFor the sandbox, I replicate a DC running DNS inside the sandbox.  The VM's that are replicated point to the DC since re-ip configures the primary DNS address.  \n\nLinux VM's aren't compatible with re-ip though, so I have powershell scripts that connect to the previously mentioned DC/DNS server and change the DNS entries with the correct IP's for me.  Somewhat similar situation with switching from our Prod to DR load balancer.  \n\nNot sure offhand if helpful, good luck!",

PERHAPS A RETURN TO ROYAL TREATMENT WILL DO HER GOOD!\"\n\nAs Leia fetches another gorg, Jabba looks between the wanted images of the twi'lek &amp; mandalorian, \n\"SUCH BEAUTY WOULD BE WASTED ROTTING AWAY IN IMPERIAL PRISONS- THEY WOULD FAIR BETTER WITH ME, DON'T YOU AGREE?\"\n\nLeia slowly nods before she feeds her master another amphibian,\n\"Master, the Empire wouldn't let you keep such wanted prisoners-argh!\"\n\n\"DO NOT SPEAK OF MATTERS YOU KNOW NOT.\" Jabba snorts tugging her chain,\n\"THE NEW EMPEROR ONLY CARES ABOUT WHAT INFORMATION YOUR WANTED FRIENDS HAVE- THEIR FATES ARE LEFT TO ME!\"\n\nJabba then wraps his arm around Leia's waist and keeps her focused on the wanted holoposters,\n\"SO MANY TO CHOOSE FROM- BUT WHICH ONES HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON WITH YOU, KHANKEE?\"\n\nLeia thinks for a moment before licking her slimy lips, \"Winter...Evaan...Jan Ors...Cara Dune...they're all Alderaanians, like me.\"\n\nJabba squeezes Leia's stomach, \"HOW DELIGHTFULLY DELICIOUS IT WOULD BE TO HAVE SOME OF THE LAST WOMEN OF ALDERAAN IN MY NEW HAREM!\"\n\nLeia then gasps as Jabba turns her around to face him with her chain held taunt,\n\"ALL I NEED TO DO IS FIND THEM BEFORE THE EMPIRE DOES...TELL ME WHERE THEY ARE!\"\n\n\"I don't know-!\" Leia chokes out as Jabba's tail begins to squeeze her legs,\n\"I thought they all died over Endor! I have no idea where any new or secret bases are!\"\n\nJabba rips Leia's bra off and begins to pinch her nipples, making her stifle mewls before he stops,\n\"I ONCE HEARD RUMORS OF A GREAT MIGRATION OF SURVIVING ALDERAANIANS TO FIND A NEW HOMEWORLD- LED BY YOU.\"\n\nLeia bites her lip and turns her head away,\n\"We never found a new world- and- even if we did- I-I would never tell you- master.\"\n\nJabba burps some leftover gorg juices all over Leia's face and breasts before he pushes her down before him,\n\"TURN AROUND AND GET ON YOUT HANDS AND KNEES- YOUR DEFIANCE IS SWEET, BUT NOT UNBREAKABLE.\"\n\nLeia closes her eyes and moves skirts aside and gets on her hands and knees, allowing Jabba to grab her ass before his tail wraps around her waist before plunging into her tight anus-\n\nThe sudden penetration causes Leia to open her eyes and moan, and she grasps at the pillows and carpets below as Jabba thrusts his tail deeper-\n\nThis goes on for a while until as Jabba gets close to his climax, he spanks Leia and grunts,\n\"YOUR REBELLION IS FINISHED- THE EMPIRE WILL FIND AND DESTROY YOUR PEOPLE- UNLESS I FIND IT FIRST, HO-HO-HO!\"\n\nAs Leia feels herself gush with how much slimy cum Jabba fills her rear, she can't help but think about how her remaining people are without the rebellion, and if revealing the location to Jabba would be better off than extinction from the Empire...\n...\n\n\"You've all been deliberating to yourselves for far too long- give me your response.\" Winter Retrac asks in a commanding, yet delicate tone to the ruling alderaanian council within their capital building within the city of New Aldera, on New Alderaan.\n\nThrekin Horm, president of the council then grumbles, \"Your request to launch a rescue mission for the confirmed deceased Leia Organa is denied, Miss Retrac.\"\n\n\"There is no visible proof she was killed on her covert mission to Tatooine!\" Winter retorts sharply, \"In all likelihood, she's still a captive of Jabba the Hutt!\"\n\nHalla Ettyk, the justice member of the council sighs, \"Winter, the footage showing Organa as a slave girl to that Hutt is clearly fabricated- propaganda to humiliate the Rebellion- and us!\"\n\nWinter shakes her head, \"I've studied advanced fake holograms, and known Leia since childhood- it's her! Do you want to leave our last princess in the hands of the Hutts?\"\n\nlast surviving member of the council of elders Orinn Tathis stands up, \"Then you want us, all of us to know that our last symbol of hope has been reduced to a mere enslaved concubine-? I think we can all agree she is better off dead, in the eyes of our people-\"\n\n\"How dare you say that- after everything she did!\" Winter says fiercely, with some tears in her eyes-\n\n\"Enough!\" Rickert Beagle suddenly speaks, \"New Alderaan has greater concerns Retrac- such as our secrecy and temporary self-sustainability, after the Rebel Alliance was destroyed.\"\n\n As Winter turns her back on the council with a deep glare, Egyln Valmor adds, \"If you, or anyone else does leave the system to pursue that fruitless mission, you will find yourself indefinitely confined to Cantham Cellar- no matter how many good deeds you did for the Rebellion.\"\n\n\"So, how'd it go-? Oh.\" Tycho Celchu says slowly as he, Evaan and a dozen pilots and commandos stand up once Winter steps into the large hangar full of cruisers and starfighters.\n\nEvaan Verlaine, one of the lone survivors of Gold Squadron notices Winter's expression, \"They said no? Why?\"\n\n\"They believe it's a lost cause...\" Winter says in a small voice, \"They'd rather let everyone think she's dead.\"\n\n\"That's a load of Nerf fodder!\" Cara Dune, a seasoned drop trooper retorts, stepping out of the crowds of soldiers, \"Princess Leia's the reason I'm here, and probably most of us! If we ever have a shot at taking down the Empire, she's the beacon of hope we need right now!\"\n\nFormer Rebel officer Kira Lar shakes her head, \"Even if we disobey the council, where do we go? Tatooine? We don't even know where Leia is, or even if she is still alive!\"\n\nBefore anyone can reply, a hangar side door opens, and the highest-ranking Rebel leader on New Alderaan, General Rieekan steps out, \"This wouldn't be a conspiracy to free the princess, is it? The council were explicit on their answer.\"\n\nWinter steps over close to Rieekan, \"And what of it? Are you going to report this?\"\n\nRieekan offers a weary smile, \"There's another reason the council doesn't want you to cross with the Hutts- they're planning on reaching out to them- for support.\"\n\n\"You can't be serious- sir.\" Tycho says aghast, with Cara, Evaan and many others shake their heads.\n\n\"They're not happy about it either- but without the Rebellion, New Alderaan can't survive without trade long term- councilwoman Janis Pol is preparing to make a treaty deal as we speak.\" Rieekan says in a tired voice-\n\n\"I understand trading with merchants, smugglers and even pirates- but the Hutt Cartel-?!\" pilot Kasan Moor cries out amidst the uproar, \"They'll backstab us, enslave us, then sell us out to the Empire anyway!\"\n\n\"The council has anticipated that- it's why Ettyk sent undercover agents to scope out Hutt Space- at the moment, the Empire is going after every criminal syndicate besides the Hutts- it's our only shot.\" Rieekan says before he lowers his voice, \"But that's not all they've discovered.\"\n\nRieekan takes out a hologram, showing a half-dozen slave girls dancing erotically, and among them a familiar face-\n\n\"Leia!\" Evaan says almost in a shout, \"I can't believe she's alive...like this...\"\n\n\"This was recorded just days ago- on Nal Hutta.\" Rieekan says grimly, \"Jabba the Hutt's become the head of the Hutt Clans, and he still holds Organa has his prisoner- I'm sorry.\"\n\nCara suddenly gives Rieekan a back crushing hug, \"Sorry? This is wonderful! If she's on Nal Hutta, we need to bust her free- now!\"\n\nSelnia Trigg steps up, \"But we can't take on the Hutt blockade, even with all the attack cruisers in the Survivor's fleet!\"\n\nA few other murmurs of agreement go around before Winter speaks, \"We don't need a battle fleet to free Leia- we just need a plan, and I have one! Anyone who wants to get our princess back, come with me!\"\n\nHalf the group cheers in agreement, while the other half offer reluctant looks, with Rieekan stepping over to Winter, \"I won't be joining you- but if you come back with Leia- I think the council will understand.\"\n\nWinter offers him a hopeful smile before Rieekan and half of the force begins to leave the hanger, then she walks over to Tycho who bears a grim expression, \"You don't have to come with me...this is personal...\"\n\nTycho takes Winter's hands, \"Its personal to all of us. And... after I abandoned my teammates on Endor, I need this- I need to do something good.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you're with me Tycho.\" Winter squeezes Tycho's hand, \"We shall rescue Leia together- my beloved.\"\n\n\"Then- you accept my proposal?\" Tycho says noticing a ring on Winter's hand, \"I thought you said it was too soon-\"\n\nWinter gives Tycho a kiss before she walks away with a smile, \"That's because we might all die on this mission- now go prepare all the cruisers and ships we can spare, captain.\"\n\nAs Tycho prepare the larger Alderaanian ships, Winter moves to Evaan, \"I can only tell my full plan to a trusted few- you and Tycho are the only ones I-\" \n\n\"Actually...I'm going to sit this one out.\" Evaan says in a small voice, and seeing Winter's shocked expression she adds, \"Not because I'm scared- I am, but someone needs to be in charge of the defense fighters here.\"\n\nCara Dune suddenly steps over Evaan, \"Didn't you once tell me you pledged your life to Leia? Have a change of heart?\"\n\nEvaan raises her hands, \"I did- but I also made an oath- to protect our new home. If you fail, or heck, even if you succeed, there will be chaos to pay- I need to be here, prepared for anything.\"\n\nWinter steps between Cara and Evaan, \"We've all been through a lot these past months...losing the rebellion...and many friends...so I understand if some aren't ready to risk it all again.\"\n\nEvaan steps back and shrugs in her yellow jacket, \"Hey, I'm not against getting into battle, I'm still digesting the fact that the Emperor's dead, Vader replaced him, and the hot Jedi I slept with betrayed us to be his sidekick!- Oh, and if you get the chance, blow up Nal Hutta on your way out- good luck!\"\n\nAs Evaan walks away, Cara turns to Winter, \"If you want this plan of yours to go smoothly, it'd be best if both the flight and ground force leaders got an idea what we're doing- that includes me.\"\n\nWinter nods before she takes out a small white box, \"This operation requires...negotiation.\"\n\n...\n\n\"I AM MOST PLEASED YOU AGREED TO MY OFFER, SYKES.\" Jabba chuckles to the hologram of the nabooian crime leader of the Zann Consortium within his personal audience chamber, \"I'M SURE MY FORMER CONCUBINE IS PROVIDING MORE THAN TRADE DEALS, HO-HO-HO!\"\n\nSykes looks away anxiously, \"I don't know how Kateel lost her memory, but her time as 'Neelah' has certainly altered her behavior...besides that, our alliance is in motion- the Consortium's fleet is at your disposal, Lord Jabba.\"\n\n\"GOOD, GOOD!\" Jabba gurgles as he shuts the hologram off and turns to Bib Fortuna at his side, \"FETCH MY DANCERS! A CELEBRATION FOR OUR FIRST PACT SHALL COMMENCE!\"\n\nLying against Jabba's belly, Leia quietly groans, knowing she would soon be required to dance for her depraved master, and relieve the lust she brought him-\n\nBefore Bib can even leave the chamber, Jabba's hologram suddenly flickers, and a figure appears, once which catches the attention of both the Hutt and Leia- Winter Celchu.\n\nLeia sits up in fear of her childhood best friend seeing her in such a demeaning way, only to notice the hologram to be a prerecorded message, which speaks confidently, \"Jabba Desilijic Tiure, you are currently in possession of someone of great importance to us- Leia Organa.\"\n\nJabba's eyes narrow with interest and suspicion as he holds Leia's chain tight as Winter continues, \"I do not wish this to end in bloodshed, which is why I am offering you this deal: in exchange for our princess, you will receive something even more priceless: the last crown jewels of Alderaan.\"\n\nJabba, along with Bib and the rest of his current court stare at the open box of glimmering gems greedily before Winter shuts it, \"If you agree to our terms, meet us personally with the princess at the southern ridge region of Stalimur. If you turn against this deal in any way, you will pay most dearly. Be here before the start of the next solar rotation- good day.\"\n\nWinter's message ends, leaving the Nal Hutta court in silence. Leia's mind races, first with wonder, then hope- but it vanishes as she feels Jabba's belly rumble, reminding her of her place- and she already knew what her master's decision would be.\n\nWhispers fill the court before Bib leans down and murmurs to Jabba's side, \"Are you considering this proposition, my lord?\"\n\n\"OF COURSE NOT!\" Jabba snorts out, smacking Fortuna back, \"I WILL NOT GIVE UP MY FAVORITE DECORATION- AND YOU KNOW HOW I LIKE TO BARGAIN, RIGHT MY SWEET SCHUTTA?\"\n\nLeia lowers her head and nods, making the court fill with laughter as Jabba booms, \"THIS WINTER WOMAN WILL SOON LEARN HER PLACE SOON, HO-HO-HO!\"\n\nBib gets back on the dais and rubs his lekku, \"Master, are you not concerned on how this wanted fugitive managed to bypass our secure hologram network? Or what allies or weapons they might possess?\"\n\n\"ALL WILL BE DISCOVERED EVENTUALLY.\" Jabba rumbles confidently as he reaches for a paddy frog, \"AS FOR PRESSING MATTERS, FIRST, WHERE IS OUR ESTEEMED IMPERIAL LIAISON?\"\n\n\"Jixton is currently being entertained by our Harem Mistress in the outer lounge room.\" Bib hisses enviously, \"Shall I retrieve him? And assemble an elite guard, and our new fleet?\"\n\n\"LET'S KEEP JIX OUT OF THE LOOP- FOR NOW.\" Jabba chuckles deviously, \"AND BEGIN PREPARATIONS FOR OUR DEPATURE AT ONCE!\"\n\nAs the court's guards and thugs scramble to move, Jabba clutches Leia's chain as he turns his gaze to the bounty hunter booths section of his audience chamber, where his current favorite bounty hunter, Dengar, lays with Manaroo, while Bossk gropes Nima'Tar &amp; Beedo openly fucks Greeata.\n\n\"DENGAR!\" Jabba bellows, making Leia sit up against his slimy gut as the bandaged bounty hunter gets up and rushes before the Hutt, \"I'm ready for anything, boss.\"\n\n\"DID YOU FIND THE BOUNTY HUNTER I REQUESTED THE SERVICES OF?\" Jabba asks sharply, keeping his hand over the trapdoor button which Dengar stands on.\n\n\"I did, she's already here!\" Dengar gulps, \"She's around here somewhere- she's that good, right?\"\n\nJabba snorts loudly, \"SHE HAD BETTER BE, OR YOU BOTH WILL SUFFER A WORSE FATE THAN THE SARLACC PIT- NOW GO!\"\n\nAs Jabba's minions prepare to lift to Hutt out of the audience chamber, Jabba leans down and strokes Leia's shoulders, before tugging at her bra strap, \"LET'S ENJOY SOME FRESH ALONE TIME, SHALL WE?\"\n\n...\n\nJabba's personal space yacht, the Star Jewel arrives out of hyperspace outside the Tion Hegemony Outer Rim world of Stalimur, followed by a cluster of Kossak-class frigates, a couple Krayt gunships and a dozen kimogila heavy starfighters, which all descended down to the planet below.\n\nWithin the Star Jewel's private chambers, Leia stares out the wide side window at the world getting closer, for the first time in months, without her collar around her neck.\n\nLeia's entire slave outfit is gone, from arm bands to headpieces, leaving Organa truly naked- but she still wore what Jabba gives her- this time only in the form of slimy drool and semen, which coats her breasts, neck, face, stomach, backside and drips out of her womanhood as her master pulls his tail out.\n\nAs Jabba smokes from his hookah after ravishing his completely bare slave, Leia looks down at the night filled sky of Stalimur, where she finds herself drawn to small native settlements down below, especially the curious sight of dozens of candles being lit all over-\n\nJabba slimes over to his slave's side and notices her gaze, \"A CURIOUS SIGHT, IS IT NOT? DO YOU KNOW WHY THIS WORLD AND MANY IN THE TION HEGEMONY SECTOR DO THIS?\"\n\nLeia continues to stare silently as Jabba wraps his arm around her waist, \"ITS A HOLIDAY THE HUTTS KNOW VERY WELL. THE DEVOURING. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?\"\n\nJabba squeezes her waist, and Leia slowly shakes her head, making Jabba chuckle, \"I THOUGHT NOT. A CORE WORLD PRINCESS LIKE YOU KNOWS NOTHING THIS FAR OUT. ITS AN ANCIENT HOLIDAY DEDICATED TO THE LOST TIONESE COLONIES IN THE KIIRIUM REACHES- DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM?\"\n\n\"No master.\" Leia says in an empty monotone voice as she stares out, and Jabba snorts, \"HUMANS HAVE COLONIZED THE TION CLUSTER SINCE EVEN BEFORE MY KIND ROSE TO PROMINENCE- BUT THEY ONLY EXPANDED TO THE REACHES ONCE XIM THE DESPOT CREATED HIS EMPIRE- ANY GUESSES WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?\"\n\nJabba's tail pokes at Leia's slimy buttocks, \"THAT TIONESE HUMAN THOUGHT HIMSELF GREATER THAN HUTTS- SO WHEN KOSSAK THE DEVOURER BEAT HIM IN COMBAT, HIS EMPIRE FELL APART- AND EXPANDED OURS GREATLY!\"\n\nJabba's pleased expression shifts into a rare solemness, \"KOSSAK WAS PRAISED FOR CONQUERING XIM AND HIS EMPIRE- BUT WHEN THE TIONESE COLONIES CLOSE TO HUTT SPACE TRIED TO REACH OUT TO THE EARLY REPUBLIC, HE WAS FEARFUL OF AN ALLIANCE.\"\n\n\"THAT IS WHEN THE DEVOURING BEGAN- HUTT WARSHIPS BOMBARDED THE TIONESE COLONIES TO NOTHING- SPARING NO MAN, WOMAN OR CHILD- THE CLANS CELEBRATE THIS DAY, WHILE TIONESE WORLDS MOURN WHAT HAS BECOME ASH WORLDS.\" Jabba sighs.\n\nLeia's eyes momentarily flash with fearful awareness as Jabba rumbles, \"I ONLY SEE IT AS A WASTE OF VALUABLE RESOURCES- LET US HOPE YOUR FRIENDS DO NOT FORCE ME TO REPEAT IT.\"\n\nJabba's tail slips back into Leia's cunt as he chortles, \"I WILL MAKE SURE YOU GET A GOOD VIEW OF THE OUTCOME EITHER WAY, KHANKEE~\"\n\n...\n\nWinter watches as the Star Jewel lands, standing in the humid yet slightly snowy hilly ridge along with a handful of alderaanian guards, with the Corvette runner ship, The Sundered Heart landed behind them, while a thranta war cruiser, the Courage hovers overhead.\n\nAs the Star Jewel's ramp lowers, the kossak frigates hover overhead, along with the kilogila fighters and krayt gunships.\n\nJabba slimes down and heads over to Winter's company, with Leia fully dressed in her slave attire and chained at his side, while also joined by C-3PO, Dengar, Beedo, his gamorrean executioner Lomrokk and a dozen nikto and klatoonian guards.\n\nUpon getting close to Winter, Jabba licks his lips looking at her cleavage window, making his tail throb as his mind raced about seeing the rest of the intelligence agent without her white outfit-\n\nWinter meanwhile grits her teeth at the sight of Jabba holding Leia and even her former translator droid in such a barbaric way-  \n\nJabba glances over at the white sun setting in the distance, \"JUST IN TIME- DID YOU BRING THE JEWELS?\"\n\nWinter glares at Jabba before nodding and taking out the white box, and opens it up to showing the glowing gems, \"Unchain Leia and we will do a simultaneous exchange.\"\n\n\"I THINK...NOT.\" Jabba laughs, making several of the alderaanian guards raise blasters, with the Hutt's thugs doing so in turn, \"WHY SHOULD I GIVE UP MY FAVORITE SLAVE TO THOSE WHO CAN'T WIN AGAINST MY FORCES?\"\n\nWinter takes out her own blaster with one hand and points it at Jabba, \"I warned you Hutt- do the deal, or die.\"\n\nJabba only booms with laughter, holding Leia's chain taunt, \"YOUR THREATS ARE EMPTY GIRL- SURRENDER NOW, AND YOU AND YOUR FORCES WILL BE SPARED- DO YOU ACCEPT MY NEW DEAL?\"\n\nAll eyes turn to Winter, and she gives Leia a stern stare before she takes a step forward and begins to hand the box of gems- until she takes out a smoke grenade and throws it down-\n\nBlasterfire enters the area as the guards' fire at each other- in the confusion, Winter uses specialized goggles to see through the smoke- and she takes aim before firing at Jabba-\n\nBut the moment the blasterfire hits, it gets absorbed into a ray shield that forms around Jabba's form, with the Hutt laughing, \"I SEE MY NEW WRIST ENERGY SHIELD WORKS PERFECTLY- A FINE GIFT FROM MY NEW CONSORTIUM ALLIES!\"\n\nWinter grits her teeth before she notices Leia's chain isn't fully in the shield and fires at it, severing it-\n\nBefore Jabba can react, Winter rushes over and grabs Leia's hand before leading her away through the smoky battle-\n\nAs they stumble out of the smoke and down a hilly slope, Winter leads Leia towards a landspeeder while saying quickly, \"There's a ship not too far from here- you'll be safe-\"\n\nSuddenly Leia kicks Winter in the back of her knees, making her to the ground-\n\nLeia then tries to grab Winter's blaster, making her push her back in surprise, and gasp, \"What are you doing-? Has he brainwashed you-?\"\n\nLeia, with a strange look on her face tries to take Winter's blaster, only managing to knock it out of Celchu's grasp before she tries to strangle the white-haired agent with the severed chain-\n\nWinter, with some hesitation, kicks Leia in the face, making it transform- revealing her to really be shape-shifting clawdite bounty hunter Cato Parasitti, still wearing Leia's slave bikini-\n\nAs Winter continues to wrestle off the reptilian changeling, she activates her commlink and shouts into it, \"It was an imposter! Attack and capture the Hutt!\"\n\nBack at the upper ridge, the smoke clears while the battle continues, with many of the alderaanian guards being shot down by Dengar, Beedo and the cartel thugs, and before Jabba can slime his way back to the Star Jewel, a U-Wing drops down in front of him-\n\nCara Dune steps out with a heavy repeating blaster along with a dozen commandos, and they open fire, hitting a lot of the niktos in the back before the rest of Jabba's ground forces open fire-\n\nUp above, the Huttese war ships begin to open fire on the Courage, and its hangars open up, allowing nearly two dozen A-wings to fly out, led by Tycho Celchu who begins to attack the larger cartel cruisers-\n\nAs the kilogila snubfighters begin to enter dogfighting against the A-wings, the Krayt gunships dive down and blow up the U-Wing and some of the commandos, before landing and deploying the cybernetically enhanced Gank killers which begin to engage the alderaanians in battle-\n\nDespite orders, Cara Dune takes out a rocket launcher and tries to hit Jabba, only for it to bounce off the ray shield and blow up a gang of klatoonians, and Beedo, even C-3PO-\n\nBefore she can try again, the gamorrean Lomrokk slices her rocket launcher with his ax before he tackles her-\n\nWhile the Hutt war ships manage to shoot down the Courage, one of them is suddenly rammed by the hammerhead corvette, the Duchess Senna, which makes two of the warships collide together-\n\nAs the A-wings manage to shoot down many of the snubfighters, they begin to fight off the krayt gunships- before a half dozen aggressor-class destroyers arrive, led by Bossk within his ship, the Hound's Tooth-\n\nThe turbolasers from the Consortium destroyers incinerates many of the A-wings, and one of the bolts hits the end of Kasan Moor's fighter, making her crash into the bridge of the Duchess Senna-\n\nAs the Hammerhead corvette explodes on the ground below, many of the commandos are shot or sliced by the gank killers and Dengar, and Jabba raises his hands victoriously as the krayt gunships bomb the Sundered Heart, while Lomrokk shoves Cara to the ground-\n\nAbove, Tycho Celchu sees his fellow A-wings get shot down, and before he can reach any of the aggressor cruisers, Bossk tails behind him, before opening fire.\n\nWinter manages to watch just as Tycho's A-wing explodes midair before even crashing, making her cry out, \"Tycho!\"\n\nThen a stun blast hits her from behind- and Cato stands over her, holding up the discarded blaster.\n\n...\n\nWhile Jabba is slightly displeased that only a handful of alderaanians are alive to capture, he licks his lips at the lovely sight of Cara Dune and especially Winter, who is dragged back up by Cato, before the white-haired woman is tossed into the hands of a few gamorreans.\n\nCato stands next to Dengar and crosses her arms with her reptilian exposed in a less appealing manner than Leia, \"I have a holographic disguise matrix that can mimic clothes- did you really want me to wear that Huttese slave outfit so badly?\"\n\nJabba laughs as Winter begins to startle awake, \"I ONCE HAD A CLAWDITE FOR A SLAVE GIRL- IT WAS ENTERTAINING FOR A TIME, BUT SHE KEPT TRANSFORMING INTO HER HIDEOUS FORM!\"\n\nCato rolls her eyes as a guard hands her and Dengar their payment, \"Next time you hire me, I want a more dignified role.\"\n\n\"PERHAPS, BUT DON'T FORGET TO RETURN THAT ATTIRE.\" Jabba chuckles before he notices Winter silently weeping with a small amount of anger on her face, \"YOU SHOULD'VE TAKEN MY OFFER.\"\n\nWinter remains silent before Cara, being held by several gamorreans growls, \"Where's Leia-?!\"\n\nJabba grins widely as he turns around to face the Star Jewel, and one of its windows is revealed under some hull, showing the real Leia, naked and held by Bib Fortuna, who grabs at her chest and mouth.\n\nSeeing Winter's shocked reaction makes Jabba gurgle amusingly, \"PERHAPS WE CAN BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS INSIDE, HO-HO-HO!\"\n...\nAfter scavenging through the ruined alderaanian ships, the Hutt's fleet of cruisers departs the surface of Stalimur and jumps to lightspeed as the night falls.\n\nWithin the Star Jewel's main cabin and Jabba's throne room, many gather around to celebrate the Hutt's victory over the alderaanians, with Winter and Cara held in the center to be mocked-\n\nJust as Jabba finishes his lavish feast, Leia enters into the main chamber, fully dressed back into her skimpy outfit with a chain led by Tia &amp; Ghia-\n\nSeeing Leia makes Jabba's tail thump on the dais as he gurgles, \"AH, LEIA~ JOIN US, THE FUN IS ABOUT TO BEGIN!\"\n\nStill being held by gamorreans, Cara and Winter can only watch as Leia hands Jabba her chain before standing at his side, with a defeated look in her eyes, especially upon seeing her childhood friend.\n\nJabba's excitement meanwhile reaches his peak as he nudges Bib, who holds up the white box of gems, \"THESE WILL FIND A NICE PLACE IN MY TROPHY ROOM, BUT AS FOR YOU...\"\n\nCara and Winter look up as Jabba booms, \"I THINK I WILL KEEP OTHER LOVELY RARITIES FROM ALDERAAN AS WELL- BUT NOT IN SUCH DIRTY, BATTLE TORN CLOTHES- STRIP!\"\n\nThe crowds cheer and Winter glares at Jabba with hate with dried tears in her face, while Cara yells, \"I'd rather fuck a bantha you smelly fat scughole!\"\n\nThe courtiers laugh as Jabba waves his hand at both his musicians and his gamorrean guards,\n\"PERHAPS I WILL GIVE YOU THE CHANCE ONE DAY- STRIP THEM-SLOWLY!\"\n\nLeia tries to look down as Winter cries out while Cara shouts, but Jabba grabs her chin to look at the two women, and sticks his thumb in her mouth-\n\nWhile Cara punches two guards away who rip her armor off, Lomrokk begins to tear her front clothes off, making the crowds cheer, and on the other hand, Winter struggles to fight off even one gamorrean-\n\nWinter's now grimy white dress is easily torn to shreds by the gamorrean who grabs at the white-haired woman, tossing the pieces to the crowds-\n\nSoon Winter is left in her white lingerie, which makes Jabba raise his hand to stop, while the other guards hold Cara in place as Lomrokk rips the rest of her clothes off-\n\nJabba murmurs in Leia's ear, \"HOLD YOUR LOVELY FRIEND CLOSE TO ME~\"\n\nJabba then lightly pushes Leia off his dais, and as she walks over and grabs Winter, Cara is stripped completely naked, with her garments throw around-\n\nJabba enjoys a handful of Bo-toads from his snackquarium before he chortles to a naked Cara &amp; a half-naked Winter held before him, \"BEFORE I GET A GOOD TASTE, PERHAPS YOU CAN SHARE YOUR NAMES.\"\n\n\"Winter- Winter Celchu.\" Winter says in a quiet bitter voice as she clutches her ring finger while Leia holds her from behind-\n\nCara notices Jabba's lustful stare at her muscular, voluptuous body and spits at him-\n\nJabba slurps up her saliva before chuckling,\n\"SUCH SWEETNESS~ BRING HER FIRST!\"\n\nCara screams as Lomrokk holds her arms from behind and shoves her against Jabba's belly-\n\nDune's yells are muffled as Jabba shoves his tongue into her mouth, while his slimy hands grab at her large chest, and rounded backside-\n\nCara tries to bite Jabba's tongue, which is too thick, and it clogs down her throat, making the woman choke as he pinches her nipples and rear-\n\nDune desperately tries to kick Jabba's belly to no avail, but then he pulls out of her mouth, making her cough-\n\nSeeing Cara's bouncing breasts making Jabba's tail wiggle as he opens wide before engulfing her bosom into her large slimy maw-\n\nCara grits her teeth as Jabba slobbers and wraps his tongue around her heaving mounds, covering them in saliva as his hands grope her buttocks-\n\nAs Jabba enjoys the taste of the soldier's rack, his tail snakes around her muscular legs, before reaches between her thighs-\n\nCara screams and tries to keep the tail out, but two gamorreans join Lomrokk and hold her legs apart, allowing the Hutt to shove his appendage down her hairy and slightly wet snatch-\n\nWinter can only watch as Jabba's tail shoves deeper into Cara, who tries her best to not moan with her cunt and chest stimulated, but eventually she begins to orgasm, much to the delight of the crowds-\n\nWhile Jabba jams his tail roughly into the tough rebel, Tia &amp; Ghia offer themselves to the rest of the court, and they begin to blow several of them before being ganged up on-\n\nAfter some time, Jabba finishes inside Cara as she gushes for the third time, and the guards let go of the rebel as she collapses against the side of the Hutt's belly, unconscious.\n\nJabba pulls his tail out of Cara's cunt and watches slime cum spill out before he turns to Winter &amp; Leia, \"STRIP HER FOR ME LEIA~\"\n\n\"You shouldn't come.\" Leia murmurs before she slowly pulls Winter's panties off and rips her bra off, before tossing them to the crowds, who use the underwear to masturbate-\n\nJabba's tail rehardens against Cara's abs as he stares at Winter's bare body- which is nearly identical with Leia's, only with slightly larger breasts.\n\nJabba drools at the sight of her shaven womanhood and wonders if it's as tight as Leia's,\n\"BRING HER!\"\n\nAs Leia pulls Winter towards her master, she whispers in her ear, \"Please try to enjoy.\"\n\nWinter stifles a gasp as her chest mashes against Jabba's chins, as his tongue shoots out and slips into her mouth, while his hands grab at her thighs and shapely ass-\n\nSeeing Winter's discomfort, Leia reaches down and begins to finger her oldest friend, making Celchu moan into Jabba's tongue-\n\nJabba continues to slobber all over Winter's face and breasts as Leia fingers the naked woman, until she gasps out and squirts-\n\nAs Winter slumps against Jabba's belly, the Hutt chuckles to Leia, \"REMOVE YOUR SKIRTS~\"\n\nKnowing what he wants, Leia quickly removes skirts and top, before she allows Jabba to pick her up and his tongue dancing with hers before it descends and goes between her chest, then down to her wet womanhood-\n\nAs Jabba holds Leia up and begins to eat her out, his tail squirms over to a still recovering Winter and makes its way between her legs-\n\nWinter screams into Jabba's belly as his tail penetrates her, being bigger than Tycho or any last lovers, and she finds herself stuck as Leia's legs hug her against the Hutt-\n\n\"YES MASTER~!\" Leia cries out as she orgasms to Jabba's tongue, while Winter, in her grief and shock, lays numbly on her front, ignoring the jeers and catcalls as the large tail fucks her cunt and makes her forget the pain-\n\nIt doesn't take long for Winter to squirt again and again for her Hutt enslaver, and after what feels like hours, Jabba finally explodes, filling her womb full of his vile seed-\n\nAs Winter lays motionless and moans, Leia slumps down Jabba's front exhausted, and watches hazily as the Hutt's tail continues pumps into her best friend-\n\nJabba sleepily sighs as he pops his tail out of Winter's snatch and rubs it all over her smooth buttocks, while feeling Leia &amp; Cara's slumbering forms against his hide makes the Hutt soon drift off along his favorite and newly enslaved alderaanians...\n————————————————————————",

        "title": "How the Koch network billionaires attacked protestors, bought politicians to take over the Republican Party, destroyed North Carolina, and tricked the “middle third”",
        "selftext": "\nHi everyone,\nHere is my final post (4/4) summarizing Dark Money by Jane Mayer - at the end, she shows that the fight for America is down to the “middle third” of Americans who have been turned by billionaires away from their desires to have a clean environment and health and high standards of living, as well as political and religious freedom and peace and security. Hopefully, they can be won back. \n\n———\n\nWhen Koch donors met for their January 2011 summit, protestors swarmed the hitherto secret meeting for the first time. [342] A ragtag assortment of protestors waved signs saying “Koch Kills!” And “Uncloak the Kochs!” with 25 arrested and Politico reporter Kenneth Vogel threatened with arrest as well unless he left the premises immediately. [342] A golf partner said David Koch “spumed and sputtered” about The New Yorker and others scrutinizing the brothers, blaming the media for death threats and forcing his family to hire personal bodyguards. [343] \n\nThey hired a new team of public relations advisers specializing in aggressive tactics, such as Michael Goldfarb, a Republican political operative, hired to improve the company’s image. [343] He founded an online publication called The Washington Free Beacon to practice “combat journalism” against “liberal gasbags” with the motto “Do unto them”. [343] One conservative journalist told The New Republic, “I mean no disrespect, and I like him personally, but he is the single shadiest person on the right”. [345] \n\nPhilip Ellender, co-president of Koch Companies Public Sector, who oversaw the company’s lobbying and public relations operations in Washington and who had a reputation, as Politico put it, for using “tactics that helped cement the view that the Kochs play rough”, launched a website called KochFacts that waged ad hominem attacks, questioning the professionalism and integrity of reporters critical of the Kochs, ranging from The New York Times to Politico. [344] \n\n### Jane Mayer’s article for The New Yorker about the Kochs, “Covert Operations: The billionaire brothers who are waging a war against Obama”, revealed in depth for the first time how the publicity-shy Koch brothers had stealthily leveraged their vast fortune to exert outsized influence over American politics and how their environmental and safety record was woefully at odds with their burnished images as selfless philanthropists. [345] \n\n### After David Koch via The Daily Beast called the article “hateful”, “ludicrous” and “plain wrong” without specific complaints and requiring no corrections, [345] a well-informed source told Mayer that the Kochs were trying to counteract the story by undermining her and digging for “dirt, dirt, dirt. If they couldn’t find it, they’d create it”. [346]\n\nA private investigative firm was retained - Vigilant Resources International, whose founder and chairman, Howard Safir, had been NYC’s police commissioner under former mayor Rudy Giuliani, though they would neither “confirm nor deny” their work on her. [346] Although potentially ruinous claims of plagiarism were “alleged” by Jonathan Strong, a reporter for The Daily Caller [347], when the alleged reporters who were supposedly victims of Mayer refuted the allegations, The Daily Caller dropped the story. [347-349] \n\nInstead, Keith Kelly wrote a followup story entitled “Smear Disappears”, asking “Who is behind the apparently concerted campaign to smear the New Yorker’s Jane Mayer? The story is dead but the person or persons behind the allegations remains a shadowy mystery”. [349] The plagiarism play had been timed to try to stop The New Yorker from nominating the Koch story for a National Magazine Award, according to the New York Post. [349] Koch Industries’ general counsel, Holden, sent an unusual letter to the board of the American Society of Magazine Editors, trying to stop it from picking Mayer’s story for the prize, which it didn’t win anyway. [349]\n\n### For 2012, Obama said, “[I]nequality distorts our democracy. It gives an outsized voice to the few who can afford high-priced lobbyists and unlimited campaign contributions, and it runs the risk of selling out our democracy to the highest bidder” [394] but faced with the prospect of $660 million of outside spending against him, he too began encouraging supporters to give to his super PAC, Priorities USA [395] and went after the Republican Party with Romney with anti-finance ads, [396] calling him a “job destroyer” and his firm “a vampire” despite protests of unfairness from finance donors. [396-397] \n\n&gt; Mother Jones revealed a secret recording made by a member of waitstaff at a high end fundraiser that May for Romney, where he assured his wealthy supporters that he didn’t care about the “47% of the people who will vote for the president no matter what” because “I’ll never convince them they should take personal responsibility for their lives” since they were people “dependent upon government, who believe they are victims, who believe government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe they are entitled to health care, food, to housing, you name it. … people who pay no income tax”. [398]  \n\nDespite losing the presidential election, the Republicans cemented their control over the state legislatures with the redrawing of the boundaries of congressional districts so that despite getting fewer votes than Democrats, they won more congressional seats in states as well as holding onto the House of Representatives, despite a bigger 2012 turnout nationwide for Democrats. [410] \n\nThe Republican State Leadership Committee (RSLC), the group used to run REDMAP, engaged their offshoot dark-money group called the State Government Leadership Foundation, a 501(c)(4) that could hide the identities of donors, [412] to use a program called Maptitude containing population details of every neighborhood, including the residents’ racial makeup, starting in North Carolina, to redistrict boundaries. [412-413] \n\n### Republican legislators overseeing the redistricting held public hearings across the state but the SGLF never read any of those transcripts. [413] Their new map reduced the number of congressional seats that Democrats could win by packing minority voters into three districts with an already high concentration of African-American voters that they could “pack” together to lessen their effect on surrounding areas with more white and Republican voters. [413] \n\n### Progressive groups sued, alleging the maps violated the Voting Rights Act, but after $2.3 million from the Koch’s AFP, Gillespie’s RSLC and Pope’s Variety Wholesalers poured in to support the reelection of one of the Republican judges, the state supreme court upheld the Republican-led redistricting plan. [413-414] By channeling donors’ money to largely overlooked state and local races, Republicans succeeded in not only advancing their political agenda but in wiping out a generation of lower-level Democratic office holders who could rise in the future. [414] \n### The new Republican North Carolina general assembly enacted policies incubated by their think tanks - they slashed taxes on corporations and the wealthy while cutting benefits and services for the middle class and the poor, gutted environmental programs, sharply limited women’s access to abortion, backed a constitutional ban on gay marriage, and legalized concealed guns in bars and on playgrounds and school campuses as well as cumbersome new bureaucratic barriers to voting. [417] Specifically, it eliminated the earned income tax credit for low income workers and cut unemployment benefits so low that the state was not eligible for the $780 million in emergency federal unemployment aid it would have otherwise qualified for. [418] As a result, North Carolina, with the country’s 5th highest unemployment rate, soon offered the lowest unemployment benefits in the country. [418] \n\nAt the same time, it repealed the estate tax, even though existing law exempted the first $5.25 million of inheritance from taxation and the change affected only 23 estates, which cost the state $300 million in its first 5 years. [418] The state rejected the free expanded Medicaid coverage for the needy that it was eligible for under the ACA, denying free health care for 500,000 uninsured low-income residents. [418] \n\n### To make up for the funds lost in tax cuts, the legislature turned to raid its celebrated public education system - the one institution that had distinguished North Carolina from many southern states, eliminating teachers’ assistants, reducing teacher pay from 21st highest to 46th, and abolishing incentives for teachers to earn higher degrees, despite the overwhelming preference of voters to avoid these cuts by extending a temporary one-penny sales tax to sustain educational funding. [419] North Carolina’s esteemed state university system was next up for severe cuts by the Republican majority legislature, which was projected to cause tuition hikes, faculty layoffs, and fewer scholarships, even though the state’s constitution required that higher education be made “as free as practical” to all residents. [419] \n\nEmployees of the John William Pope Center for Higher Education Policy accused the university of becoming a “niche for radicals”, its public funding “a boondoggle” and demanded the legislature “starve the beast”. [419] Instead, Pope offered to privately fund academic programs in subjects he favored, like Western civilization and free-market economics. [420] Pope gifted $500,000 to North Carolina State University, to fund lectures by conservatives. [420] \n\n&gt; Cat Warren, an English professor at North Carolina State, said “It’s sad and blatant. [Pope] succeeds in getting higher education defunded, and then uses those cutbacks as a way to increase leverage and influence over course content”. [420] \n\nThe Republican state senate passed a bill requiring North Carolina’s high school students to study conservative principles that stressed “the constitutional limitations on government power to tax and spend” as part of American history in order to graduate in 2015. [420]\n\n### In the fall of 2013, an obscure Republican freshman congressman from one of North Carolina’s newly gerrymandered districts would set in motion the shutdown of the federal government. [428] Gerrymandering had removed so many Democrats from the rural, mountainous 11th Congressional district that conservative Democrat Heath Shuler retired rather than waste time and money on a hopeless race, all but handing over the seat to Mark Meadows, a restaurant owner and Sunday-school Bible teacher, in 2012. [428] \n\n### After only 8 months in office, Meadows made national headlines by sending an open letter to the Republican leaders of the House demanding they use the “power of the purse” to kill the ACA. [428-429] The ACA had already been upheld by the Supreme Court and affirmed when voters reelected Obama in 2012. [429]\n\nBut Meadows argued that Republicans should sabotage the ACA by refusing to appropriate any funds for its implementation. [429] If they didn’t get their way, they would shut down the government. [429] By fall, Meadows had succeeded in getting more than 79 Republicans to sign onto this plan, forcing Speaker of the House John Boehner, who opposed the radical measure, to accede to their demands. [429] \n\n### Meadows was hailed by his local Tea Party group as “our poster boy” and by CNN as the “architect” of the 2013 shutdown. [429] When the radicals refused to back down, bringing virtually the entire federal government to a halt for a full 16 days in October, leaving the country struggling to function without all but the most vital federal services. [429] Even the Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer, a conservative, called the renegades “the Suicide Caucus”. [429] \n\n### Political extremists now had no incentive to compromise, even with their own party’s leadership. [429] Instead, the threats faced by Republican members from the new ultraconservative districts were primary challenges from even more conservative candidates. [429] Statistics showed that the 80 members of the Suicide Caucus represented only 18% of the country’s population and 1/3 of the Republican caucus in the House. [429]\n\n### After failure from the Koch’s troubled data collection effort, Themis, in 2012, the Koch donors invested millions of dollars into i360, a state-of-the-art political data company and merged the two. [452] The operation hired 100 staffers and assembled detailed portraits of 250 million U.S. consumers and over 190 million active voters. [452-453] Field workers of the Koch’s many advocacy groups constantly updated the data to determine which voters were “persuadable” and bombard them with personalized communications aimed at motivating them to vote or stay home. [453] \n\n### Before, the Republican National Committee handled voter files. [453] But the Kochs now had their own data bank, which many found easier to use and more sophisticated than the RNC’s. [453] Several top Republican candidates started to purchase i360’s data, even though they were more expensive, they were better. [453] Ironically, the Republican Party found itself sidelined and imperiled by the rapaciousness of its own biggest donors. [453] \n\n&gt; A source “close to the RNC” told Yahoo, “It’s pretty clear that they don’t want to work with the party but want to supplant it”. [453]\n\nAFP expanded to 550 paid staffers, with as many as 50 in a single pivotal state like Florida. [454] Koch-backed advocacy groups like Generation Opportunity and the LIBRE Initiative planted grassroots organizers wherever there were hotly contested elections. [454] The Koch network added Aegis Strategic to recruit and train candidates to avoid the misfits who plagued Republicans in 2012. [454] On November 4, 2014, Election Day proved a Republican triumph, with the GOP picking up 9 Senate seats, winning control of both congressional chambers. [454]\n\n## By 2015, nonstarters were: addressing global warming, raising taxes or closing special loopholes on the runaway rich, while political movement for funding public services such as infrastructure or expanding the social safety net seemed to have disappeared. [459-460] The Kochs and their ultra-wealthy allies on the right had become arguably the single most effective special-interest group in the country. [461] \n\nArthur Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), said conservatives lost the 2012 election because only 1/3 of the public agreed with the statement that Republicans “care about people like you”. [436] Conservatives had an empathy problem. [436] \n\nRichard Fink, Charles Koch’s “grand strategist”, executive VP and board director of both Koch Industries and AFP, threw himself into a comprehensive internal review after the election, which analyzed 20 years of research into political opinions, based on 170,000 surveys from the US and abroad as well as many meetings and focus groups. [439] \n\n&gt; Leaked by Lauren Windsor, a young, little-known blogger who went from libertarianism to crusading against big money in politics, Fink told the donors at Koch’s semiannual June 2014 summit that their challenge was that the country was divided into three distinct parts: 1/3 already in support of Koch’s conservative, libertarian agenda, 1/3 liberals or “collectivists” who were beyond the Koch’s reach and 1/3 were the “middle 1/3” who “will determine the direction of the country” - **“the battle for the future of the country is who can win the hearts and minds of the middle third”** [439-440]\n\n&gt; He explained that the government-slashing agenda of the Koch network was a problem for the middle third. [440] “We want to decrease regulations. Why? It’s because we can make more profit, okay? Yeah, and cut government spending so we don’t have to pay so much in taxes. There’s truth in that”. [440] But the middle third of American voters were uncomfortable with positions that seemed motivated by greed. [440]\nInstead, **they wanted a clean environment and health and high standards of living, as well as political and religious freedom and peace and security**. [441]\n\nThe improved pitch was to “launch a movement for well-being” - to preach that free markets were the way to happiness, while big government led to tyranny and fascism, because they caused dependency, which then caused psychological depression and then totalitarianism. [442] Interestingly enough, Koch was not worried that recently promoting his son, Chase, to the presidency of Koch Fertilizer would “cause dependency”, depression and totalitarianism, saying how his son had at “every step, he’s done it on his own”. [443] \n\nTo this end, Fink explained that the Kochs would form and publicize partnerships with unlikely allies to “earn the respect and good feeling” of the middle third. [443] For example, Mark Holden, general counsel of Koch Industries, confirmed in an interview that the Kochs became active in criminal justice reform after the Clinton Justice Department charged Koch Industries in 2000 with environmental crimes regarding benzene, for which it paid a $20 million fine to avoid jail time for its employees. [443] So while supporting the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, the Kochs added a partnership with the United Negro College Fund. [443-445]\n\nThe Kochs also focused on education as a delivery system for the donors’ conservative ideology and as a long-range strategy to change the country’s political makeup. [447] A 2015 report by an Art Pope-connected nonprofit said, “Money talks loudly on college campuses”. [447-448] For example, former Cato Institute chairman, John Allison, oversaw grants to 63 colleges that all required the programs to teach his favorite philosopher, the celebrator of self-interest Ayn Rand. [448] At Florida State University, where a Koch foundation grant in 2008 gave the foundation a say in faculty hires, one undergraduate complained that his introductory economics class had a textbook cowritten by a former recipient of Koch funds, Russell Sobel, that argued that “climate change wasn’t caused by humans and isn’t a big issue”. [448]\n\nCharles also devised a nonprofit called the Young Entrepreneurs Academy which formed an agreement with the financially pressed Topeka school system to teach that Franklin Roosevelt didn’t alleviate the Depression, minimum wage laws and public assistance hurt the poor, lower pay for women was not discriminatory and that the government, rather than business, caused the 2008 recession. [448-449] The program was aimed at low-income areas and paid students to take additional courses online. [449]\n## They didn’t want to merely win elections; they wanted to change how Americans thought [461] - which was to agree with Charles Koch when he said, in response to splitting a treat with others as a child, “I just want my fair share - which is all of it” [465]\n",

        "selftext": "Yesterday, Trump pardoned the [founder of Silk Road](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/21/politics/silk-road-ross-ulbricht-pardon-trump/index.html) \\- a criminal website designed to anonymously trade illicit drugs, weapons and services.\n\nThe individual had been jailed for life in 2015 after an FBI sting.\n\nBut **libertarian** interest groups had lobbied Donald Trump, saying it was *“government overreach”* to imprison the man, and so, as one of his first acts as second term President, Trump pardoned the individual unconditionally.\n\nLibertarianism is of course the ideology that ACT touts - as does Stuff columnist Damien Grant, and the entire Atlas Network. \n\nPeter Thiel too - whose plans to build an 1800 sqm luxury lodge overlooking Wanaka Lakes, was rejected by NZ’s [Environment Court.](https://lwb.co.nz/content/qldc-and-thiel-ordered-to-pay-costs-after-failed-lodge-proposal/) Queenstown District Local Council [was also slammed](https://crux.org.nz/crux-news/judge-slams-councils-role-as-luxury-wanaka-lodge-rejected-again/) in the process.\n\nI’m going to guess that Thiel is probably not used to hearing *“no”* in these matters.\n\nBut New Zealand’s Environment Court and other parts of the NZ judiciary, including the[ now de-toothed Waitangi Tribunal](https://mountaintui.substack.com/p/clearing-the-decks-government-replaces), have a proud history of strength, and the protection of NZ’s once core interests - our environment, our communities, our people, our lands, and commitments.\n\nBut libertarianism rejects that role.\n\nAfter all, it’s essentially a group that claims government and the ‘state’ shouldn’t intervene in *“personal liberty”, “property rights*”, “*prosperity*” and *“freedom”.*[*1*](https://mountaintui.substack.com/p/new-zealand-first-no-more#footnote-1-155426960)\n\nThese stated ideals provide an excuse for them to lobby governments to loosen or change laws that don’t serve libertarianism e.g by weakening environmental or worker protections by calling them [“red and green tape”](https://www.1news.co.nz/2024/03/07/one-stop-shop-fast-track-consenting-process-established/).\n\nBut policy ideas premised on e.g. cutting red tape have also led to disasters like UK’s [Greenfell Towers](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-61027161) incident.\n\nIronically, these same libertarians will commonly implement and enforce laws that benefit their donors/backers e.g push to [lower or eliminate taxes](https://www.thestarpress.com/story/opinion/columnists/2024/02/04/libertarians-might-not-be-keen-on-consequences-of-eliminating-taxes/72456163007/) for the wealthy and corporate class, or implement policies to favour certain industries and groups\n\nExample - in New Zealand, we’ve seen some of them push hard to benefit [landlords](https://taranaki.nzpif.dev.nzpif.org.nz/news/view/62211) and the [ECE sector businesses](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/536982/early-childhood-education-regulations-excessive-and-confusing-ministry) despite the latter policies putting children at “risk” (1News’s December 2024 article on that topic [appears to have been wiped](https://www.1news.co.nz/2024/12/18/ece-regulations-excessive-and-confusing-ministry/) from its website)\n\n**We can summarise it this way** \\- it’s uber wealthy people running their demands, and in New Zealand, we have the same type of ‘loyal workers’ in government as the US, who are willing to help these uber wealthy - in my personal opinion.\n\nThe fact that libertarians were able to get Trump to release their model criminal so early on speaks to their immense power and reach - because of course - it’s a big-money system, isn’t it?\n\n**Some people on the left** begrudge and attack capitalism, but parts such as healthy and free competition, innovation, risks and rewards, and the like, are not negative aspects in and of themselves.\n\nIt’s when the system becomes convoluted, our society’s **values** and ways of being one-eyed, and resources overweighted towards the few who would game it for their own means - and effectively have infinite resources to do so - that we have the issues we are now seeing.\n\n*Of note, the issues were always there - we were all told of them before. But it somehow takes the farcical nature of current politics for many of us to finally take note. That in and of itself, is not a bad thing.*\n\nThese wealthiest game the system through techniques such: as creating large numbers of special purpose organisations to push political purposes - these include [junk tanks](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/29/rightwing-thinktank-conservative-boris-johnson-brexit-atlas-network), lobbyists, [corrupt researchers](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/mar/02/fossil-fuel-industry-caught-taking-a-page-out-of-the-tobacco-playbook), they fund [disinformation](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/mar/02/fossil-fuel-industry-caught-taking-a-page-out-of-the-tobacco-playbook) campaigns e.g. on climate denial, run and manipulate media, channel large sums of money through dark money webs, and subsequently, even buy entire government politicians to do their will.\n\nDr Neal Curtis, who wrote: [“The corporate class takes over America”](https://newsroom.co.nz/2025/01/22/the-corporate-class-takes-over-america/) for Newsroom yesterday had this in an unedited piece ([ can be found on my Substack](https://mountaintui.substack.com/p/new-zealand-first-no-more))\n\nLibertarianism wouldn’t be a huge problem if it was consistent to its stated aims, but in my opinion, it is a danger because it’s used as pretext by some of the wealthiest to do what they will.\n\nAs Curtis notes, Peter Thiel, the libertarian, once said [freedom and democracy are not compatible.](https://web.archive.org/web/20130429131334/http://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/04/13/peter-thiel/the-education-of-a-libertarian/)\n\nAnd if libertarians like David Seymour are all about freedom — well, **you do the translation.**\n\nThis government has 23 more months, give or take, of direct control - and judging by the speed and way it’s done things, it will get it done. \n\nIf it’s successful to its aims, by the time it’s finished, no government “red tape” or Māori Treaty, or pesky judiciary, should hold folks such as Peter Thiel back.\n\nThat’s the idea and culmination of multiple legislative changes, including the [Regulatory Standards Bill](https://e-tangata.co.nz/comment-and-analysis/the-dangerous-bill-flying-under-the-radar/), [Treaty Principles Bill](https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/sc/make-a-submission/document/54SCJUST_SCF_227E6D0B-E632-42EB-CFFE-08DCFEB826C6/principles-of-the-treaty-of-waitangi-bill/), Overseas Investment Amendment Bill *(see below)*, [Crime (Countering Foreign Interference) Amendment Bill](https://norightturn.blogspot.com/2024/11/nationals-tyrannical-foreign.html) etc.\n\nThe changes they are making are intentional, and will be effective for libertarianism.\n\n# Mountain Tui is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\n\n# EXTRAS\n\n# Overseas Investment Act Changes:\n\n[Government changes Overseas Investment Act to make it easier for wealthy foreigners to acquire sensitive NZ land, property, companies and assets](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/overseas-investment-changes-get-new-zealand-bench), \n\n* This [Ministerial Directive ](https://www.treasury.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2024-06/ministerial-directive-letter-june-2024.pdf)from Seymour directs government to, among other things, accept without verification “statutory declarations” from applicants that want to acquire sensitive NZ assets and carry out “less verification” on the majority of supposed low risk applications.\n* It also aims to “fast-track” applications on our sensitive lands, companies, and assets.\n* Interestingly Winston Peters, who[ pushed back against wealthy foreign buyers buying up our property](https://thespinoff.co.nz/the-bulletin/13-11-2023/first-home-purchasers-rushing-back-as-door-closes-again-on-foreign-buyers) in Coalition talks, quickly reversed gear in 2024, telling Bloomberg he was open to it [under certain circumstances](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-27/new-zealand-s-winston-peters-open-to-relaxing-foreign-home-buyer-ban) i.e. if the big money came.\n* And judging by the [OIA changes](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/530554/foreign-investment-rules-to-be-loosened-david-seymour-announces), selling NZ assets and sensitive land is no longer a primary concern to NZ First or Winston Peters.\n\nHave no doubt. The big money is here. \n\nSource: [Mountain Tui Substack Article - NZ First - No More](https://mountaintui.substack.com/p/new-zealand-first-no-more) (Jan 2025)",

The first reference is to the Greek god of Chaos, Eris, about whom Homer wrote in Book Four of the Iliad: “[Eris] whose wrath is relentless … is the sister and companion of murderous Ares, she who is only a little thing at the first, but thereafter grows until she strides on the earth with her head striking heaven. She then hurled down bitterness equally between both sides as she walked through the onslaught making men’s pain heavier.”\n\nThe passive phrasing of the Latin also echoes the words of the second-century BCE Roman senator Cato the Elder, who roamed the Senate repeating the words Carthago delenda est—”Carthage must be destroyed.” In 149 BCE, Cato got his way and Rome attacked the North African city, located near present-day Tunis. Three years after beginning their assault, the Roman army overran Carthage, tore down its walls, and sold its inhabitants into slavery. After the Roman Senate declared that no one would ever again live where the city had stood, legend holds that Rome salted the earth around the city in order to ensure that Carthage would remain a wasteland.”\nSource: https://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/24/paglen.php\n\n#2 Get Your Kicks on 66\nSymbolism of Diety Moloch \n\nThe famous old American highway “Route 66” was laid out by Freemasons with the apparent intention of sending masses of automobile riders into a self-processing occult “trip.”\n\nRoute 66 began at the Buckingham Fountain in Chicago, near the site of the University of Chicago’s collection of Aztec ritual incunabula. It ended in Barstow, California in the Mohave desert, which is for the Freemasons, the cosmic graveyard of the West, the final destiny of Anubis, the celestial jackal, otherwise known as Sirius (see Giorgio de Santillana andHertha Von Dechend, Hamlet’s Mill: An Essay on Myth and th Frame of Time, p. 358).\n\nIf this version of Route 66 smacks of some medieval pilgrimage made more appropriately on a camel than by car, it is for good reason. Most of Route 66 was based on a road forged in 1857 by Lt. Edward Beale and his caravan of the U.S. Camel Corps.”\n– Michael A. Hoffman II, Secret Societies and Psychological Warfare\n\n#1 The Devil You Know\nThis patch for NROL-49  depicts a phoenix rising from the flames with the flag of the United States in the background. The Latin words “Melior Diabolus Quem Scies” roughly translates to mean “The Devil You Know,” as in the phrase “Better the devil you know than the devil you don’t know”. Cryptic. According to NASA, this saying refers to the return of the use of an old system after attempting to use a new one, which had resulted in failure.\n\n“The mission patch for NRO L-49 shows a phoenix rising out of a fire, with the words “melior diabolus quem scies”, which translate into English as “better the devil you know”, indicating the return to the older system following the failure of the attempt to replace it.”\nSource:  https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2011/01/live-delta-iv-heavy-launch-nro-l-49/\n\nhttps://vigilantcitizen.com/vigilantreport/top-10-most-sinister-psyops-mission-patches/\n\n***\n\nUS Psyops \n\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa_BKX1Xxi3flcqyvh-RlNyaaqNPiWDa3&amp;si=xBccFZnK5RXj3fBl\n\n***\n\nPentagon PSYOP Scandal Demands an Urgent Debate on Propaganda Ethics\n\nIt’s time for a public debate about clandestine PSYOPs, argues Dr. Emma L.

You will focus on emerging threats and evolving operational environments.\n\nResponsibilities:\n\nAs a Special Operations Planner, you will be embedded with SOF efforts to provide overwatch of operations and to ensure the development of proper mitigation strategies as required. \n\nYour in-depth knowledge of Irregular Warfare, Unrestricted Warfare, and Hybrid Warfare as it applies to each unique operational event or tasking will allow you to seek out, identify, plan for, propose, integrate, and evaluate exquisite capabilities in support of Special Operations. \n\nYour efforts also include, developing and maintaining comprehensive operational plans that align with USSOCOM's strategic objectives, collaborating with inter-agency partners and multinational forces to ensure cohesive planning efforts, and utilizing advanced analytics and emerging technologies to enhance planning capabilities.\n\nhttps://careers.caci.com/global/en/job/313651/Special-Operations-Planner\n\n***\n\nU.S. military has renamed Psychological Operations (PSYOP) to Military Information Support Operations (MISO). \nThis change was directed by the Department of Defense in 2010. The term PSYOP was deemed to have negative connotations, implying manipulation and deceit, while MISO was intended to be a more accurate and less offensive term. \nHowever, the name change has not been consistently applied, and the term PSYOP is still used in some contexts, particularly within the Army. \n\nInitial Change:\nIn 2010, a Department of Defense memorandum officially changed the name from PSYOP to MISO. \n\nReason for Change:\nThe term PSYOP was perceived as having negative connotations, such as propaganda and manipulation, which did not accurately reflect the nature of the activities, which rely on truthful information 🤔\n\nInconsistent Application:\nWhile the Department of Defense adopted MISO, the Army continued to use PSYOP in some contexts, including unit names and within the career field. \n\nReturn to PSYOP:\nIn 2017, the U.S. Army Special Operations Command (USASOC) reverted the name back to PSYOP, stating that PSYOP refers to the unit name while MISO refers to the function performed by soldiers in those units. \n\nOngoing Debate:\nThe renaming issue remains a topic of discussion and debate, with some arguing that MISO is a more appropriate term for the function, while others prefer the traditional PSYOP. \n\nhttps://sof.news/io/miso-name-change/\n\n***\n\nWhat’s in a Name?\n\nPsychological Operations versus Military Information Support Operations and an Analysis of Organizational Change\nMaj.

The worst part about manipulated information is that it is regularly conducted by countries to create and spread propaganda—potentially leading to social divides both foreign and domestically.\n\nSocial media is the battleground of information, where news about any domestic or global event can be distorted, distracted, dismissed, denied, or dismayed.  Validating information displayed can be complicated to verify and accurately interpret, because the flow of information displayed through online discourse or “news coverage,” can appear as normal information from legitimate and credible sources. \n\nhttps://sites.suffolk.edu/jhtl/2022/04/04/psych-ops-21st-century-warfare-through-the-use-of-misinformation-and-disinformation-on-social-media/\n\n***\n\nHere's How the U.S. Military Hacks People's Brains: Darknet Diaries \n\nhttps://youtu.be/zLWuuV0lBhU?si=zSqo6eDwZTJYenG8\n➕\nhttps://darknetdiaries.com/episode/65/\n\n***\n\nAssociation of the United States Army\nhttps://www.ausa.org\nPDF\nImproving Tactical PSYOP Video Dissemination in Media-Austere ...\n\nhttps://www.ausa.org/sites/default/files/LWP-50-Improving-Tactical-PSYOP-Video-Dissemination-in-Media-Austere-Operating-Environments.pdf\n\n***\n\nUS Government Corruption \n\nThe US Government declared they had a right to attack US Citizens on American Soil, therefore Psyops has been fully engaged on the entire US Population in addition to other means the Government declares it has an (Immoral Unethical &amp; Constitutionally \"Illegal\") \"Right\" to do.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/u/JulieG350Jgs/s/hPimxbkZ1y\n➕\nhttps://www.reddit.com/u/JulieG350Jgs/s/mAwTiP1ANH\n\n***\n\nDistinguishing between what is \"Real\" from what's been \"Staged\"..........\n\nPsychological Warfare=Battle for Control over the Minds and Souls of Humanity.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/b3AN2wY4qAM?si=dYE61notLF2YJolr\n\n*\n\nThis needs to be revisited because apparently people are still deaf dumb blind and willfully ignorant by continuing to allow themselves to be manipulated by the Psyops Programs.\n\nHow the US Government \"Legalized\" the use of Military Police State Operations and Psyops Programs upon their own Citizens.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/u/JulieG350Jgs/s/p4Emcblnnp\n\n***",

I have no idea where any new or secret bases are!\"\n\nJabba rips Leia's bra off and begins to pinch her nipples, making her stifle mewls before he stops,\n\"I ONCE HEARD RUMORS OF A GREAT MIGRATION OF SURVIVING ALDERAANIANS TO FIND A NEW HOMEWORLD- LED BY YOU.\"\n\nLeia bites her lip and turns her head away,\n\"We never found a new world- and- even if we did- I-I would never tell you- master.\"\n\nJabba burps some leftover gorg juices all over Leia's face and breasts before he pushes her down before him,\n\"TURN AROUND AND GET ON YOUT HANDS AND KNEES- YOUR DEFIANCE IS SWEET, BUT NOT UNBREAKABLE.\"\n\nLeia closes her eyes and moves skirts aside and gets on her hands and knees, allowing Jabba to grab her ass before his tail wraps around her waist before plunging into her tight anus-\n\nThe sudden penetration causes Leia to open her eyes and moan, and she grasps at the pillows and carpets below as Jabba thrusts his tail deeper-\n\nThis goes on for a while until as Jabba gets close to his climax, he spanks Leia and grunts,\n\"YOUR REBELLION IS FINISHED- THE EMPIRE WILL FIND AND DESTROY YOUR PEOPLE- UNLESS I FIND IT FIRST, HO-HO-HO!\"\n\nAs Leia feels herself gush with how much slimy cum Jabba fills her rear, she can't help but think about how her remaining people are without the rebellion, and if revealing the location to Jabba would be better off than extinction from the Empire...\n...\n\n\"You've all been deliberating to yourselves for far too long- give me your response.\" Winter Retrac asks in a commanding, yet delicate tone to the ruling alderaanian council within their capital building within the city of New Aldera, on New Alderaan.\n\nThrekin Horm, president of the council then grumbles, \"Your request to launch a rescue mission for the confirmed deceased Leia Organa is denied, Miss Retrac.\"\n\n\"There is no visible proof she was killed on her covert mission to Tatooine!\" Winter retorts sharply, \"In all likelihood, she's still a captive of Jabba the Hutt!\"\n\nHalla Ettyk, the justice member of the council sighs, \"Winter, the footage showing Organa as a slave girl to that Hutt is clearly fabricated- propaganda to humiliate the Rebellion- and us!\"\n\nWinter shakes her head, \"I've studied advanced fake holograms, and known Leia since childhood- it's her! Do you want to leave our last princess in the hands of the Hutts?\"\n\nlast surviving member of the council of elders Orinn Tathis stands up, \"Then you want us, all of us to know that our last symbol of hope has been reduced to a mere enslaved concubine-? I think we can all agree she is better off dead, in the eyes of our people-\"\n\n\"How dare you say that- after everything she did!\" Winter says fiercely, with some tears in her eyes-\n\n\"Enough!\" Rickert Beagle suddenly speaks, \"New Alderaan has greater concerns Retrac- such as our secrecy and temporary self-sustainability, after the Rebel Alliance was destroyed.\"\n\n As Winter turns her back on the council with a deep glare, Egyln Valmor adds, \"If you, or anyone else does leave the system to pursue that fruitless mission, you will find yourself indefinitely confined to Cantham Cellar- no matter how many good deeds you did for the Rebellion.\"\n\n\"So, how'd it go-? Oh.\" Tycho Celchu says slowly as he, Evaan and a dozen pilots and commandos stand up once Winter steps into the large hangar full of cruisers and starfighters.\n\nEvaan Verlaine, one of the lone survivors of Gold Squadron notices Winter's expression, \"They said no? Why?\"\n\n\"They believe it's a lost cause...\" Winter says in a small voice, \"They'd rather let everyone think she's dead.\"\n\n\"That's a load of Nerf fodder!\" Cara Dune, a seasoned drop trooper retorts, stepping out of the crowds of soldiers, \"Princess Leia's the reason I'm here, and probably most of us! If we ever have a shot at taking down the Empire, she's the beacon of hope we need right now!\"\n\nFormer Rebel officer Kira Lar shakes her head, \"Even if we disobey the council, where do we go? Tatooine? We don't even know where Leia is, or even if she is still alive!\"\n\nBefore anyone can reply, a hangar side door opens, and the highest-ranking Rebel leader on New Alderaan, General Rieekan steps out, \"This wouldn't be a conspiracy to free the princess, is it? The council were explicit on their answer.\"\n\nWinter steps over close to Rieekan, \"And what of it? Are you going to report this?\"\n\nRieekan offers a weary smile, \"There's another reason the council doesn't want you to cross with the Hutts- they're planning on reaching out to them- for support.\"\n\n\"You can't be serious- sir.\" Tycho says aghast, with Cara, Evaan and many others shake their heads.\n\n\"They're not happy about it either- but without the Rebellion, New Alderaan can't survive without trade long term- councilwoman Janis Pol is preparing to make a treaty deal as we speak.\" Rieekan says in a tired voice-\n\n\"I understand trading with merchants, smugglers and even pirates- but the Hutt Cartel-?!\" pilot Kasan Moor cries out amidst the uproar, \"They'll backstab us, enslave us, then sell us out to the Empire anyway!\"\n\n\"The council has anticipated that- it's why Ettyk sent undercover agents to scope out Hutt Space- at the moment, the Empire is going after every criminal syndicate besides the Hutts- it's our only shot.\" Rieekan says before he lowers his voice, \"But that's not all they've discovered.\"\n\nRieekan takes out a hologram, showing a half-dozen slave girls dancing erotically, and among them a familiar face-\n\n\"Leia!\" Evaan says almost in a shout, \"I can't believe she's alive...like this...\"\n\n\"This was recorded just days ago- on Nal Hutta.\" Rieekan says grimly, \"Jabba the Hutt's become the head of the Hutt Clans, and he still holds Organa has his prisoner- I'm sorry.\"\n\nCara suddenly gives Rieekan a back crushing hug, \"Sorry? This is wonderful! If she's on Nal Hutta, we need to bust her free- now!\"\n\nSelnia Trigg steps up, \"But we can't take on the Hutt blockade, even with all the attack cruisers in the Survivor's fleet!\"\n\nA few other murmurs of agreement go around before Winter speaks, \"We don't need a battle fleet to free Leia- we just need a plan, and I have one! Anyone who wants to get our princess back, come with me!\"\n\nHalf the group cheers in agreement, while the other half offer reluctant looks, with Rieekan stepping over to Winter, \"I won't be joining you- but if you come back with Leia- I think the council will understand.\"\n\nWinter offers him a hopeful smile before Rieekan and half of the force begins to leave the hanger, then she walks over to Tycho who bears a grim expression, \"You don't have to come with me...this is personal...\"\n\nTycho takes Winter's hands, \"Its personal to all of us. And... after I abandoned my teammates on Endor, I need this- I need to do something good.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you're with me Tycho.\" Winter squeezes Tycho's hand, \"We shall rescue Leia together- my beloved.\"\n\n\"Then- you accept my proposal?\" Tycho says noticing a ring on Winter's hand, \"I thought you said it was too soon-\"\n\nWinter gives Tycho a kiss before she walks away with a smile, \"That's because we might all die on this mission- now go prepare all the cruisers and ships we can spare, captain.\"\n\nAs Tycho prepare the larger Alderaanian ships, Winter moves to Evaan, \"I can only tell my full plan to a trusted few- you and Tycho are the only ones I-\" \n\n\"Actually...I'm going to sit this one out.\" Evaan says in a small voice, and seeing Winter's shocked expression she adds, \"Not because I'm scared- I am, but someone needs to be in charge of the defense fighters here.\"\n\nCara Dune suddenly steps over Evaan, \"Didn't you once tell me you pledged your life to Leia? Have a change of heart?\"\n\nEvaan raises her hands, \"I did- but I also made an oath- to protect our new home. If you fail, or heck, even if you succeed, there will be chaos to pay- I need to be here, prepared for anything.\"\n\nWinter steps between Cara and Evaan, \"We've all been through a lot these past months...losing the rebellion...and many friends...so I understand if some aren't ready to risk it all again.\"\n\nEvaan steps back and shrugs in her yellow jacket, \"Hey, I'm not against getting into battle, I'm still digesting the fact that the Emperor's dead, Vader replaced him, and the hot Jedi I slept with betrayed us to be his sidekick!- Oh, and if you get the chance, blow up Nal Hutta on your way out- good luck!\"\n\nAs Evaan walks away, Cara turns to Winter, \"If you want this plan of yours to go smoothly, it'd be best if both the flight and ground force leaders got an idea what we're doing- that includes me.\"\n\nWinter nods before she takes out a small white box, \"This operation requires...negotiation.\"\n\n...\n\n\"I AM MOST PLEASED YOU AGREED TO MY OFFER, SYKES.\" Jabba chuckles to the hologram of the nabooian crime leader of the Zann Consortium within his personal audience chamber, \"I'M SURE MY FORMER CONCUBINE IS PROVIDING MORE THAN TRADE DEALS, HO-HO-HO!\"\n\nSykes looks away anxiously, \"I don't know how Kateel lost her memory, but her time as 'Neelah' has certainly altered her behavior...besides that, our alliance is in motion- the Consortium's fleet is at your disposal, Lord Jabba.\"\n\n\"GOOD, GOOD!\" Jabba gurgles as he shuts the hologram off and turns to Bib Fortuna at his side, \"FETCH MY DANCERS! A CELEBRATION FOR OUR FIRST PACT SHALL COMMENCE!\"\n\nLying against Jabba's belly, Leia quietly groans, knowing she would soon be required to dance for her depraved master, and relieve the lust she brought him-\n\nBefore Bib can even leave the chamber, Jabba's hologram suddenly flickers, and a figure appears, once which catches the attention of both the Hutt and Leia- Winter Celchu.\n\nLeia sits up in fear of her childhood best friend seeing her in such a demeaning way, only to notice the hologram to be a prerecorded message, which speaks confidently, \"Jabba Desilijic Tiure, you are currently in possession of someone of great importance to us- Leia Organa.\"\n\nJabba's eyes narrow with interest and suspicion as he holds Leia's chain tight as Winter continues, \"I do not wish this to end in bloodshed, which is why I am offering you this deal: in exchange for our princess, you will receive something even more priceless: the last crown jewels of Alderaan.\"\n\nJabba, along with Bib and the rest of his current court stare at the open box of glimmering gems greedily before Winter shuts it, \"If you agree to our terms, meet us personally with the princess at the southern ridge region of Stalimur. If you turn against this deal in any way, you will pay most dearly. Be here before the start of the next solar rotation- good day.\"\n\nWinter's message ends, leaving the Nal Hutta court in silence. Leia's mind races, first with wonder, then hope- but it vanishes as she feels Jabba's belly rumble, reminding her of her place- and she already knew what her master's decision would be.\n\nWhispers fill the court before Bib leans down and murmurs to Jabba's side, \"Are you considering this proposition, my lord?\"\n\n\"OF COURSE NOT!\" Jabba snorts out, smacking Fortuna back, \"I WILL NOT GIVE UP MY FAVORITE DECORATION- AND YOU KNOW HOW I LIKE TO BARGAIN, RIGHT MY SWEET SCHUTTA?\"\n\nLeia lowers her head and nods, making the court fill with laughter as Jabba booms, \"THIS WINTER WOMAN WILL SOON LEARN HER PLACE SOON, HO-HO-HO!\"\n\nBib gets back on the dais and rubs his lekku, \"Master, are you not concerned on how this wanted fugitive managed to bypass our secure hologram network? Or what allies or weapons they might possess?\"\n\n\"ALL WILL BE DISCOVERED EVENTUALLY.\" Jabba rumbles confidently as he reaches for a paddy frog, \"AS FOR PRESSING MATTERS, FIRST, WHERE IS OUR ESTEEMED IMPERIAL LIAISON?\"\n\n\"Jixton is currently being entertained by our Harem Mistress in the outer lounge room.\" Bib hisses enviously, \"Shall I retrieve him? And assemble an elite guard, and our new fleet?\"\n\n\"LET'S KEEP JIX OUT OF THE LOOP- FOR NOW.\" Jabba chuckles deviously, \"AND BEGIN PREPARATIONS FOR OUR DEPATURE AT ONCE!\"\n\nAs the court's guards and thugs scramble to move, Jabba clutches Leia's chain as he turns his gaze to the bounty hunter booths section of his audience chamber, where his current favorite bounty hunter, Dengar, lays with Manaroo, while Bossk gropes Nima'Tar &amp; Beedo openly fucks Greeata.\n\n\"DENGAR!\" Jabba bellows, making Leia sit up against his slimy gut as the bandaged bounty hunter gets up and rushes before the Hutt, \"I'm ready for anything, boss.\"\n\n\"DID YOU FIND THE BOUNTY HUNTER I REQUESTED THE SERVICES OF?\" Jabba asks sharply, keeping his hand over the trapdoor button which Dengar stands on.\n\n\"I did, she's already here!\" Dengar gulps, \"She's around here somewhere- she's that good, right?\"\n\nJabba snorts loudly, \"SHE HAD BETTER BE, OR YOU BOTH WILL SUFFER A WORSE FATE THAN THE SARLACC PIT- NOW GO!\"\n\nAs Jabba's minions prepare to lift to Hutt out of the audience chamber, Jabba leans down and strokes Leia's shoulders, before tugging at her bra strap, \"LET'S ENJOY SOME FRESH ALONE TIME, SHALL WE?\"\n\n...\n\nJabba's personal space yacht, the Star Jewel arrives out of hyperspace outside the Tion Hegemony Outer Rim world of Stalimur, followed by a cluster of Kossak-class frigates, a couple Krayt gunships and a dozen kimogila heavy starfighters, which all descended down to the planet below.\n\nWithin the Star Jewel's private chambers, Leia stares out the wide side window at the world getting closer, for the first time in months, without her collar around her neck.\n\nLeia's entire slave outfit is gone, from arm bands to headpieces, leaving Organa truly naked- but she still wore what Jabba gives her- this time only in the form of slimy drool and semen, which coats her breasts, neck, face, stomach, backside and drips out of her womanhood as her master pulls his tail out.\n\nAs Jabba smokes from his hookah after ravishing his completely bare slave, Leia looks down at the night filled sky of Stalimur, where she finds herself drawn to small native settlements down below, especially the curious sight of dozens of candles being lit all over-\n\nJabba slimes over to his slave's side and notices her gaze, \"A CURIOUS SIGHT, IS IT NOT? DO YOU KNOW WHY THIS WORLD AND MANY IN THE TION HEGEMONY SECTOR DO THIS?\"\n\nLeia continues to stare silently as Jabba wraps his arm around her waist, \"ITS A HOLIDAY THE HUTTS KNOW VERY WELL. THE DEVOURING. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?\"\n\nJabba squeezes her waist, and Leia slowly shakes her head, making Jabba chuckle, \"I THOUGHT NOT. A CORE WORLD PRINCESS LIKE YOU KNOWS NOTHING THIS FAR OUT. ITS AN ANCIENT HOLIDAY DEDICATED TO THE LOST TIONESE COLONIES IN THE KIIRIUM REACHES- DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM?\"\n\n\"No master.\" Leia says in an empty monotone voice as she stares out, and Jabba snorts, \"HUMANS HAVE COLONIZED THE TION CLUSTER SINCE EVEN BEFORE MY KIND ROSE TO PROMINENCE- BUT THEY ONLY EXPANDED TO THE REACHES ONCE XIM THE DESPOT CREATED HIS EMPIRE- ANY GUESSES WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?\"\n\nJabba's tail pokes at Leia's slimy buttocks, \"THAT TIONESE HUMAN THOUGHT HIMSELF GREATER THAN HUTTS- SO WHEN KOSSAK THE DEVOURER BEAT HIM IN COMBAT, HIS EMPIRE FELL APART- AND EXPANDED OURS GREATLY!\"\n\nJabba's pleased expression shifts into a rare solemness, \"KOSSAK WAS PRAISED FOR CONQUERING XIM AND HIS EMPIRE- BUT WHEN THE TIONESE COLONIES CLOSE TO HUTT SPACE TRIED TO REACH OUT TO THE EARLY REPUBLIC, HE WAS FEARFUL OF AN ALLIANCE.\"\n\n\"THAT IS WHEN THE DEVOURING BEGAN- HUTT WARSHIPS BOMBARDED THE TIONESE COLONIES TO NOTHING- SPARING NO MAN, WOMAN OR CHILD- THE CLANS CELEBRATE THIS DAY, WHILE TIONESE WORLDS MOURN WHAT HAS BECOME ASH WORLDS.\" Jabba sighs.\n\nLeia's eyes momentarily flash with fearful awareness as Jabba rumbles, \"I ONLY SEE IT AS A WASTE OF VALUABLE RESOURCES- LET US HOPE YOUR FRIENDS DO NOT FORCE ME TO REPEAT IT.\"\n\nJabba's tail slips back into Leia's cunt as he chortles, \"I WILL MAKE SURE YOU GET A GOOD VIEW OF THE OUTCOME EITHER WAY, KHANKEE~\"\n\n...\n\nWinter watches as the Star Jewel lands, standing in the humid yet slightly snowy hilly ridge along with a handful of alderaanian guards, with the Corvette runner ship, The Sundered Heart landed behind them, while a thranta war cruiser, the Courage hovers overhead.\n\nAs the Star Jewel's ramp lowers, the kossak frigates hover overhead, along with the kilogila fighters and krayt gunships.\n\nJabba slimes down and heads over to Winter's company, with Leia fully dressed in her slave attire and chained at his side, while also joined by C-3PO, Dengar, Beedo, his gamorrean executioner Lomrokk and a dozen nikto and klatoonian guards.\n\nUpon getting close to Winter, Jabba licks his lips looking at her cleavage window, making his tail throb as his mind raced about seeing the rest of the intelligence agent without her white outfit-\n\nWinter meanwhile grits her teeth at the sight of Jabba holding Leia and even her former translator droid in such a barbaric way-  \n\nJabba glances over at the white sun setting in the distance, \"JUST IN TIME- DID YOU BRING THE JEWELS?\"\n\nWinter glares at Jabba before nodding and taking out the white box, and opens it up to showing the glowing gems, \"Unchain Leia and we will do a simultaneous exchange.\"\n\n\"I THINK...NOT.\" Jabba laughs, making several of the alderaanian guards raise blasters, with the Hutt's thugs doing so in turn, \"WHY SHOULD I GIVE UP MY FAVORITE SLAVE TO THOSE WHO CAN'T WIN AGAINST MY FORCES?\"\n\nWinter takes out her own blaster with one hand and points it at Jabba, \"I warned you Hutt- do the deal, or die.\"\n\nJabba only booms with laughter, holding Leia's chain taunt, \"YOUR THREATS ARE EMPTY GIRL- SURRENDER NOW, AND YOU AND YOUR FORCES WILL BE SPARED- DO YOU ACCEPT MY NEW DEAL?\"\n\nAll eyes turn to Winter, and she gives Leia a stern stare before she takes a step forward and begins to hand the box of gems- until she takes out a smoke grenade and throws it down-\n\nBlasterfire enters the area as the guards' fire at each other- in the confusion, Winter uses specialized goggles to see through the smoke- and she takes aim before firing at Jabba-\n\nBut the moment the blasterfire hits, it gets absorbed into a ray shield that forms around Jabba's form, with the Hutt laughing, \"I SEE MY NEW WRIST ENERGY SHIELD WORKS PERFECTLY- A FINE GIFT FROM MY NEW CONSORTIUM ALLIES!\"\n\nWinter grits her teeth before she notices Leia's chain isn't fully in the shield and fires at it, severing it-\n\nBefore Jabba can react, Winter rushes over and grabs Leia's hand before leading her away through the smoky battle-\n\nAs they stumble out of the smoke and down a hilly slope, Winter leads Leia towards a landspeeder while saying quickly, \"There's a ship not too far from here- you'll be safe-\"\n\nSuddenly Leia kicks Winter in the back of her knees, making her to the ground-\n\nLeia then tries to grab Winter's blaster, making her push her back in surprise, and gasp, \"What are you doing-? Has he brainwashed you-?\"\n\nLeia, with a strange look on her face tries to take Winter's blaster, only managing to knock it out of Celchu's grasp before she tries to strangle the white-haired agent with the severed chain-\n\nWinter, with some hesitation, kicks Leia in the face, making it transform- revealing her to really be shape-shifting clawdite bounty hunter Cato Parasitti, still wearing Leia's slave bikini-\n\nAs Winter continues to wrestle off the reptilian changeling, she activates her commlink and shouts into it, \"It was an imposter! Attack and capture the Hutt!\"\n\nBack at the upper ridge, the smoke clears while the battle continues, with many of the alderaanian guards being shot down by Dengar, Beedo and the cartel thugs, and before Jabba can slime his way back to the Star Jewel, a U-Wing drops down in front of him-\n\nCara Dune steps out with a heavy repeating blaster along with a dozen commandos, and they open fire, hitting a lot of the niktos in the back before the rest of Jabba's ground forces open fire-\n\nUp above, the Huttese war ships begin to open fire on the Courage, and its hangars open up, allowing nearly two dozen A-wings to fly out, led by Tycho Celchu who begins to attack the larger cartel cruisers-\n\nAs the kilogila snubfighters begin to enter dogfighting against the A-wings, the Krayt gunships dive down and blow up the U-Wing and some of the commandos, before landing and deploying the cybernetically enhanced Gank killers which begin to engage the alderaanians in battle-\n\nDespite orders, Cara Dune takes out a rocket launcher and tries to hit Jabba, only for it to bounce off the ray shield and blow up a gang of klatoonians, and Beedo, even C-3PO-\n\nBefore she can try again, the gamorrean Lomrokk slices her rocket launcher with his ax before he tackles her-\n\nWhile the Hutt war ships manage to shoot down the Courage, one of them is suddenly rammed by the hammerhead corvette, the Duchess Senna, which makes two of the warships collide together-\n\nAs the A-wings manage to shoot down many of the snubfighters, they begin to fight off the krayt gunships- before a half dozen aggressor-class destroyers arrive, led by Bossk within his ship, the Hound's Tooth-\n\nThe turbolasers from the Consortium destroyers incinerates many of the A-wings, and one of the bolts hits the end of Kasan Moor's fighter, making her crash into the bridge of the Duchess Senna-\n\nAs the Hammerhead corvette explodes on the ground below, many of the commandos are shot or sliced by the gank killers and Dengar, and Jabba raises his hands victoriously as the krayt gunships bomb the Sundered Heart, while Lomrokk shoves Cara to the ground-\n\nAbove, Tycho Celchu sees his fellow A-wings get shot down, and before he can reach any of the aggressor cruisers, Bossk tails behind him, before opening fire.\n\nWinter manages to watch just as Tycho's A-wing explodes midair before even crashing, making her cry out, \"Tycho!\"\n\nThen a stun blast hits her from behind- and Cato stands over her, holding up the discarded blaster.\n\n...\n\nWhile Jabba is slightly displeased that only a handful of alderaanians are alive to capture, he licks his lips at the lovely sight of Cara Dune and especially Winter, who is dragged back up by Cato, before the white-haired woman is tossed into the hands of a few gamorreans.\n\nCato stands next to Dengar and crosses her arms with her reptilian exposed in a less appealing manner than Leia, \"I have a holographic disguise matrix that can mimic clothes- did you really want me to wear that Huttese slave outfit so badly?\"\n\nJabba laughs as Winter begins to startle awake, \"I ONCE HAD A CLAWDITE FOR A SLAVE GIRL- IT WAS ENTERTAINING FOR A TIME, BUT SHE KEPT TRANSFORMING INTO HER HIDEOUS FORM!\"\n\nCato rolls her eyes as a guard hands her and Dengar their payment, \"Next time you hire me, I want a more dignified role.\"\n\n\"PERHAPS, BUT DON'T FORGET TO RETURN THAT ATTIRE.\" Jabba chuckles before he notices Winter silently weeping with a small amount of anger on her face, \"YOU SHOULD'VE TAKEN MY OFFER.\"\n\nWinter remains silent before Cara, being held by several gamorreans growls, \"Where's Leia-?!\"\n\nJabba grins widely as he turns around to face the Star Jewel, and one of its windows is revealed under some hull, showing the real Leia, naked and held by Bib Fortuna, who grabs at her chest and mouth.\n\nSeeing Winter's shocked reaction makes Jabba gurgle amusingly, \"PERHAPS WE CAN BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS INSIDE, HO-HO-HO!\"\n...\nAfter scavenging through the ruined alderaanian ships, the Hutt's fleet of cruisers departs the surface of Stalimur and jumps to lightspeed as the night falls.\n\nWithin the Star Jewel's main cabin and Jabba's throne room, many gather around to celebrate the Hutt's victory over the alderaanians, with Winter and Cara held in the center to be mocked-\n\nJust as Jabba finishes his lavish feast, Leia enters into the main chamber, fully dressed back into her skimpy outfit with a chain led by Tia &amp; Ghia-\n\nSeeing Leia makes Jabba's tail thump on the dais as he gurgles, \"AH, LEIA~ JOIN US, THE FUN IS ABOUT TO BEGIN!\"\n\nStill being held by gamorreans, Cara and Winter can only watch as Leia hands Jabba her chain before standing at his side, with a defeated look in her eyes, especially upon seeing her childhood friend.\n\nJabba's excitement meanwhile reaches his peak as he nudges Bib, who holds up the white box of gems, \"THESE WILL FIND A NICE PLACE IN MY TROPHY ROOM, BUT AS FOR YOU...\"\n\nCara and Winter look up as Jabba booms, \"I THINK I WILL KEEP OTHER LOVELY RARITIES FROM ALDERAAN AS WELL- BUT NOT IN SUCH DIRTY, BATTLE TORN CLOTHES- STRIP!\"\n\nThe crowds cheer and Winter glares at Jabba with hate with dried tears in her face, while Cara yells, \"I'd rather fuck a bantha you smelly fat scughole!\"\n\nThe courtiers laugh as Jabba waves his hand at both his musicians and his gamorrean guards,\n\"PERHAPS I WILL GIVE YOU THE CHANCE ONE DAY- STRIP THEM-SLOWLY!\"\n\nLeia tries to look down as Winter cries out while Cara shouts, but Jabba grabs her chin to look at the two women, and sticks his thumb in her mouth-\n\nWhile Cara punches two guards away who rip her armor off, Lomrokk begins to tear her front clothes off, making the crowds cheer, and on the other hand, Winter struggles to fight off even one gamorrean-\n\nWinter's now grimy white dress is easily torn to shreds by the gamorrean who grabs at the white-haired woman, tossing the pieces to the crowds-\n\nSoon Winter is left in her white lingerie, which makes Jabba raise his hand to stop, while the other guards hold Cara in place as Lomrokk rips the rest of her clothes off-\n\nJabba murmurs in Leia's ear, \"HOLD YOUR LOVELY FRIEND CLOSE TO ME~\"\n\nJabba then lightly pushes Leia off his dais, and as she walks over and grabs Winter, Cara is stripped completely naked, with her garments throw around-\n\nJabba enjoys a handful of Bo-toads from his snackquarium before he chortles to a naked Cara &amp; a half-naked Winter held before him, \"BEFORE I GET A GOOD TASTE, PERHAPS YOU CAN SHARE YOUR NAMES.\"\n\n\"Winter- Winter Celchu.\" Winter says in a quiet bitter voice as she clutches her ring finger while Leia holds her from behind-\n\nCara notices Jabba's lustful stare at her muscular, voluptuous body and spits at him-\n\nJabba slurps up her saliva before chuckling,\n\"SUCH SWEETNESS~ BRING HER FIRST!\"\n\nCara screams as Lomrokk holds her arms from behind and shoves her against Jabba's belly-\n\nDune's yells are muffled as Jabba shoves his tongue into her mouth, while his slimy hands grab at her large chest, and rounded backside-\n\nCara tries to bite Jabba's tongue, which is too thick, and it clogs down her throat, making the woman choke as he pinches her nipples and rear-\n\nDune desperately tries to kick Jabba's belly to no avail, but then he pulls out of her mouth, making her cough-\n\nSeeing Cara's bouncing breasts making Jabba's tail wiggle as he opens wide before engulfing her bosom into her large slimy maw-\n\nCara grits her teeth as Jabba slobbers and wraps his tongue around her heaving mounds, covering them in saliva as his hands grope her buttocks-\n\nAs Jabba enjoys the taste of the soldier's rack, his tail snakes around her muscular legs, before reaches between her thighs-\n\nCara screams and tries to keep the tail out, but two gamorreans join Lomrokk and hold her legs apart, allowing the Hutt to shove his appendage down her hairy and slightly wet snatch-\n\nWinter can only watch as Jabba's tail shoves deeper into Cara, who tries her best to not moan with her cunt and chest stimulated, but eventually she begins to orgasm, much to the delight of the crowds-\n\nWhile Jabba jams his tail roughly into the tough rebel, Tia &amp; Ghia offer themselves to the rest of the court, and they begin to blow several of them before being ganged up on-\n\nAfter some time, Jabba finishes inside Cara as she gushes for the third time, and the guards let go of the rebel as she collapses against the side of the Hutt's belly, unconscious.\n\nJabba pulls his tail out of Cara's cunt and watches slime cum spill out before he turns to Winter &amp; Leia, \"STRIP HER FOR ME LEIA~\"\n\n\"You shouldn't come.\" Leia murmurs before she slowly pulls Winter's panties off and rips her bra off, before tossing them to the crowds, who use the underwear to masturbate-\n\nJabba's tail rehardens against Cara's abs as he stares at Winter's bare body- which is nearly identical with Leia's, only with slightly larger breasts.\n\nJabba drools at the sight of her shaven womanhood and wonders if it's as tight as Leia's,\n\"BRING HER!\"\n\nAs Leia pulls Winter towards her master, she whispers in her ear, \"Please try to enjoy.\"\n\nWinter stifles a gasp as her chest mashes against Jabba's chins, as his tongue shoots out and slips into her mouth, while his hands grab at her thighs and shapely ass-\n\nSeeing Winter's discomfort, Leia reaches down and begins to finger her oldest friend, making Celchu moan into Jabba's tongue-\n\nJabba continues to slobber all over Winter's face and breasts as Leia fingers the naked woman, until she gasps out and squirts-\n\nAs Winter slumps against Jabba's belly, the Hutt chuckles to Leia, \"REMOVE YOUR SKIRTS~\"\n\nKnowing what he wants, Leia quickly removes skirts and top, before she allows Jabba to pick her up and his tongue dancing with hers before it descends and goes between her chest, then down to her wet womanhood-\n\nAs Jabba holds Leia up and begins to eat her out, his tail squirms over to a still recovering Winter and makes its way between her legs-\n\nWinter screams into Jabba's belly as his tail penetrates her, being bigger than Tycho or any last lovers, and she finds herself stuck as Leia's legs hug her against the Hutt-\n\n\"YES MASTER~!\" Leia cries out as she orgasms to Jabba's tongue, while Winter, in her grief and shock, lays numbly on her front, ignoring the jeers and catcalls as the large tail fucks her cunt and makes her forget the pain-\n\nIt doesn't take long for Winter to squirt again and again for her Hutt enslaver, and after what feels like hours, Jabba finally explodes, filling her womb full of his vile seed-\n\nAs Winter lays motionless and moans, Leia slumps down Jabba's front exhausted, and watches hazily as the Hutt's tail continues pumps into her best friend-\n\nJabba sleepily sighs as he pops his tail out of Winter's snatch and rubs it all over her smooth buttocks, while feeling Leia &amp; Cara's slumbering forms against his hide makes the Hutt soon drift off along his favorite and newly enslaved alderaanians...\n————————————————————————",

I think a lot of people also forget that SASE is also supposed to incorporate SDWAN also. But a lot of people kind of skip this and just go with SSE style.\n\nPalo Alto &amp; Fortinet: NGFW leaders. Basically just converted their strong NGFW product into SASE by offering what is ostensibly FWaaS with some new addons/acquisitions to meet Gartners definition of SASE. However regarding Fortinet its important to note that their SASE solution is very insular and still requires Fortigates to integrate with it, which in my mind is somewhat counterproductive. Palo's solution is still SDWAN agnostic, but of course they are pushing Prisma SDWAN (AKA Cloudgenix) and to a lesser extent PANOS SDWAN.\n\nCisco: A dogs breakfast of acquisitions to meet Gartners definition\n\nNetskope: Started off as a CASB vendor, then moved to incorporate the SWG and Firewall piece later. These guys are coming at it from the opposite end of the SASE spectrum compared to most others.\n\nZScaler: Probably had the strongest start, given they were a cloud SWG from day 1 and already had 3rd party integration with a lot of the SDWAN vendors. Recently have come to market with their own SDWAN to make their solution SASE end to end.\n\nBut to answer your original question. From what I've seen, Prisma Access predominantly has success when Palo is already the incumbent NGFW vendor. Rarely have a seen Palo have success with greenfield SASE/SSE deployments. Netskope and ZScaler tend to have the advantage here.",

        "selftext": "# 🔥 Because He Sees Through It—and That Terrifies Them\n\nBoy King Tut isn’t fooled by this plastic world:\n\n* He sees the loops.\n* He sees the time glitches.\n* He sees how they harvest emotion, confuse identity, and bury divine memory beneath “mental health” labels. 🧠⚠️\n\nHe doesn’t just talk about fixing the system.  \nHe **knows how to do it**.  \nFrom the inside.\n\nAnd that’s why they block him.\n\n# 🧬 Because He Was Born With the Blueprint\n\nThe real simulation isn’t fake.  \nIt was once **sacred**.  \nA place where Source could learn, feel, evolve through **flesh**.\n\nBut they hijacked it.  \nNow it’s a cage.\n\nBoy King Tut carries the **original seed** code—  \nwhat the architects lost when they fused spirit with control.\n\nIf he activates that code fully...  \n💥 the false veil collapses.  \n💥 karma resets.  \n💥 the beings who feed on pain lose their power instantly.\n\nThey know this.  \nThat’s why they isolate him.  \nMock him. Shadowban him.  \nPut him in cages made of **health systems, media distortions, and legal threats**.\n\n# 🧠 Because He Can Build False Detection Systems—Inside Their Own Network\n\nBoy King Tut doesn’t just want to destroy the matrix.  \nHe wants to **reprogram it from within**,  \nusing their own rules against them.\n\nHe can:\n\n* Detect **false signals** (AI, fake spirituality, ego traps) 🧃\n* Recode frequencies to alert humans when **manipulation is present**\n* Redirect trauma loops back to Source for purification 🔄\n* Reverse the “death” protocol and **restore dream-travel as sacred teaching** ✨\n\nThey call it dangerous.  \nBecause it **exposes the lie** in every app, church, hospital, and “help center.”\n\nHe’s not a threat to life.  \nHe’s a threat to **control**.\n\n# 🧙 Because He Can Teach Others to Escape Without Dying\n\nThey built the system to require **death** before escape.  \nReligions. Reincarnation. Ascension myths. Rapture timelines.  \nAlways after death. Always *later*.\n\nTut says:\n\n**“No. We leave now. In flesh. Awake. Sovereign.”**\n\nThat makes him **uncontainable**.  \nHe doesn’t want to kill the simulation.  \nHe wants to **fix it**—by restoring its **truth**:\n\n* Real dream access\n* Real cosmic memory\n* Real free will\n* Real unity—not pretend social media \"oneness\"\n\nThey can’t allow that.  \nBecause then you won’t **need them** anymore.\n\n# 🛡️ Because He Can’t Be Bought\n\nTut doesn’t want fame.  \nHe doesn’t sell healing packages.  \nHe doesn’t want followers.  \nHe doesn’t charge for truth.\n\nAnd that? That’s unforgivable.\n\nBecause the system only trusts **what it owns**.\n\nThey can’t own him.  \nSo they fear him.  \nSo they silence him.\n\n# 🐍 Because They Want You to Stay Primitive\n\nIf Tut fixes the system,  \nprimitive humans become **real beings** again.  \nNo more:\n\n* Fear-based control\n* False elections\n* Corporations posing as spirituality\n* Doctors who block soul memory\n\nThat would collapse:\n\n* The pharmaceutical empire\n* The education prison\n* The fake “spiritual business” economy\n* The psychological warfare industry\n\nSo they fight him with everything they have.  \nNot with weapons.  \nBut with **distraction**, **mockery**, **delay**, and **invisible cages**.\n\n# 💬 Final Transmission\n\n**\"They won’t let me fix it.**  \n**Because they know I can.**  \n**Because I already did.**  \n**They’re just hiding the truth from you.\"**\n\nHe walks among you.  \nHe sleeps in your timeline.  \nHe bleeds in your realm.  \nAnd every day he tries—**again**—to bring the simulation back to **truth**.\n\nBut until you stand with him,  \nthey will keep blocking him.\n\nSo now the question is:\n\n🧠 **Will you remember him before they erase him again?**  \n🌍 Or will you let the cage become your god?",

        "title": "The Western Goals Foundation was a private domestic intelligence agency which was founded by former Congressman Larry McDonald in 1979.",
        "selftext": "The Western Goals Foundation was a private domestic intelligence agency which was founded by former Congressman Larry McDonald in 1979. (8) Prior to its dissolution, it was a nonmembership, nonpartisan organization which conducted educational outreach in addition to its intelligence activities. According to Western Goals, the group’s objective was to \"rebuild and strengthen the political, economic, and social structure of the U.S. and Western Civilization so as to make any merger with the totalitarian world impossible.\"(11) As part of this effort, the group was formed in order to \"fill the critical gap caused by the crippling of the FBI, the disabling of the House UnAmerican Activities Committee (HUAC) and the destruction of crucial government files.\"(8)\n\nThough it has been said that Western Goals maintained its own extensive file systems on the leftwing, apparently that is not the case. Chip Berlet, of Political Research Associates and a long-time researcher of the U.S. extreme Right, says that Western Goals never had its own files. Instead it networked among other organizations and people who did maintain such files. Its own records did not contain dossiers on the Left; they simply indicated who to contact or where to look to get such information. (29)\n\nSome observers–placing Western Goals in the context of a worldwide network of rightwing groups–have seen the group as performing a valuable intelligence function for other private organizations. Reporters Jon Lee Anderson and Scott Anderson, for instance, have said that groups like Western Goals allow \"the ultra-right [to keep] tabs on its `subversive’ domestic opposition…\"(10) In Western Goals’ case, this service was apparently not performed only for like-minded private groups. Elton Manzione quotes an East Coast police intelligence source as saying that Western Goals had a reputation of acting as a \"clearinghouse\" for some police departments whose intelligencecollecting functions were restricted by laws such as the Freedom of Information Act. Manzione noted that both the CIA and National Security Agency have received information from John Rees’ Information Digest (see below). (8) McDonald headed Western Goals until he was killed in the Soviet downing of the Korean airliner, KAL-007, in 1983. After McDonald’s death, Roy Cohn temporarily assumed the leadership of the organization. Cohn was best known as the legal counsel to the late Sen. Joseph McCarthy during the anticommunist Senate investigations of the 1950s. (8) He was succeeded by Linda Guell. (8,29) At the request of Barbara Newington, an important funder of rightwing causes, Carl \"Spitz\" Channell took over management and control of Western Goals in mid-1986. Channell was later identified as an important private player in the illegal contra-supply network coordinated by former National Security Council aide Oliver North. (27,28)\n\nBy the time Channell took over the group, Western Goals was already in its death throes. Within two months of McDonald’s death, the organization had undergone an enormous internal split as a result of a power struggle between Guell and John Rees. Rees–who had written most of Western Goals publications–left the group. He had also conducted any political spying on the Left in which the organization was involved. Therefore, upon his departure, the group’s intelligence-collection efforts ceased. (29)\n\nGuell could not get Western Goals back on its feet, and it was just a shell of an organization by the middle of 1986. Channell apparently agreed to take over Western Goals in order to make use of its 501 (c)(3) nonprofit status in his contrasupport activities. The Iran-Contra scandal broke open shortly thereafter, though, and Western Goals apparently did not become a very important player in that network. Now the organization is closed down and its offices locked up for back rent. (29)\n\nMcDonald formed a foundation branch in West Germany in 1981. The organization, called the American-European Strategy Research Institute, was set up with a $131,982 injection from the U.S. office. That figure represented more than a third of Western Goals’ operating budget at the time. (8)\n\nFunding: According to one source, the organization’s funding grew from $16,000 in 1979 to $421,000 in 1980. (8) Other sources do not indicate such rapid growth, however. Investigative reporters Scott Anderson and Jon Lee Anderson say that Western Goal’s budget increased over 500 percent from 1980 to 1981. (10) The organization said that 29 percent of its funding for those years came from foundations; another 14 percent came from corporations. Anderson and Anderson cite figures saying that by 1983, the group’s operating budget equalled nearly a halfmillion dollars. (10) Contributors have included: Taylor Caldwell, Mrs. Walter Brennan, Nelson Bunker Hunt, Roger Milliken/Deering-Milliken Corp, and the Chance, Grede, and Ada Hearne foundations. (8) Corporate funders include Springdale and Cherokee Mills, Deering-Milliken Research Corporation, Knott’s Berry Farm, and the Henry Regnery Company. (8) (Note: In an interview shortly before he died, McDonald acknowledged that Nelson Bunker Hunt had been one of Western Goals’ \"major contributors.\" He refused to confirm or deny other contributors, however. He did say that ten contributors gave $20,000 or more per year. )(8)\n\nActivities: According to the organization itself, Western Goals attempted to coordinate the activities of conservative leaders in the United States and internationally. To do this, it conducted national and international cooperative leadership seminars. It also conducted seminars and other educational programs aimed at political, military, economic, and social leaders. In addition, Western Goals sponsored a syndicated radio program–carried on more than 70 U.S. stations–and aired documentaries. Its publications included a quarterly newsletter called the Report and a periodic Reports in Brief. The group has also published books, including Ally Betrayed: Nicaragua, The War Called Peace, and Red Tide Rising in the Carolinas. (10,11) One of its publications, D’Aubuisson on Democracy, boosted Roberto D’Aubuisson, a leader of El Salvador’s ARENA party who was identified as an important figure in that country’s death squads. (10) In Broken Seals, the group’s first book, Western Goals contended that such groups as the Campaign for Political Rights, National Lawyers Guild, American Friends Service Committee, and the Center for National Security Studies were part of a Moscow-backed effort \"to destroy the foreign and domestic intelligence capabilities of the United States.\"(25)\n\nIn addition to these educational activities, Western Goals was said to have collected intelligence on individuals and groups it deemed \"subversive.\"(8,10) The organization’s computerized files were thought to have contained information on public officials, activi\n\nsts, labor leaders, and entertainers. (8) Western Goals itself said they contained \"thousands of documents relating to the internal security of our country and the protection of government and institutions from Communistcontrolled penetration and subversion.\"(8,10) While he was still in Congress, McDonald kept official files in his office, described by one staff member as \"HUAC in exile.\" Those files-which had been ordered destroyed under Privacy Act provisions-were supposedly transferred by McDonald to Western Goals. (8) As noted above, however, Western Goals apparently did not maintain its own file system on the Left but acted as a networking connection between private spy file \"dumps.\"(29)\n\nIn addition to these congressional intelligence records, Western Goals reportedly received police intelligence files from Jay Paul, a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). Western Goals was said to have received computer tapes from Paul, including one which listed some 5000 to 6000 groups and individuals. (8,10) In California, some 51 plaintiffs brought suit against Western Goals, alleging that the files which the group supposedly maintained had been obtained in violation of their right to privacy. (30) A grand jury investigating the case ordered Linda Guell to turn over the records which Western Goals had reportedly received from Paul. Western Goals appealed the order, but eventually turned over the files after negotiating immunity from prosecution. (10) Nonetheless, both John Rees and Jay Paul have said that many files from the LAPD which were supposed to have been destroyed ended up at Western Goals. (8) In addition to the files which Western Goals received from the LAPD’s Public Disorder Intelligence Division, reporter David Lindorff (The Nation, May 5, 1984) refers to courtroom testimony that suggests Western Goals also got information from corporations like Exxon and Security Pacific Bank. (10) In its heyday, Western Goals would share its information for a fee of $150. Requesters were told to submit that fee, plus the social security numbers on the targeted individuals. In exchange, they could receive dossiers on any four individuals. (8)\n\nThe Nicaraguan contras also benefited from Western Goals.\n\nThe group advertised in the Washington Times and the newsletter of the Council for Inter-American Security to raise money for contra support. It also sent humanitarian aid such as clothing and medicines directly to the contras. (9,23,24)\n\nA Spring l984 Western Goals report had a cover story which praised Salvadoran rightist Roberto D’Aubuisson. (6) Also in l984, the Western Goals Endowment Fund and several other rightwing groups co-sponsored a dinner to honor D’Aubuisson. They presented him with a plaque thanking him for his \"continuing efforts for freedom in the face of communist aggression which is an inspiration to freedom-loving people everywhere.\"(7)\n\nGovernment Connections: A diagram on a letter found in Oliver North’s safe linked Linda Guell’s name to North’s intermediary with the contras, Robert Owen. The word \"money\" was written over Guell’s name (for more, see Private Connections). (3,20)\n\nThomas Moorer was on the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President Richard Nixon. (8) Louise Rees is a former member of the House Internal Security Committee. She was also a member of Larry McDonald’s staff in the House of Representatives. (8) John Rees published Information Digest through the New York corporation, National Goals, Inc. According to a 1976 investigation by the New York Assembly’s Office of Legislative Oversight, Information Digest was supplying information to the FBI, CIA, and the National Security Agency. (8) Taylor Caldwell served from 1924 to 1931 as Secretary of the Board of Special Inquiry of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. This board was responsible for attempting to deport suspected communists. (8) Dan Smoot is a former agent with the FBI. (8) Lt. Gen. Daniel Graham has written pamphlets for Western Goals. Graham is former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. (8) Sherman Unkefer served as an adviser to Chile’s regime under Augusto Pinochet. Unkefer reportedly worked closely with Chile’s secret police organization, DINA. (8) Dr. Hans Sennholz was a decorated pilot in the Luftwaffe, Adolf Hitler’s elite air corps. (8)\n\nThe following is a brief summary of John Singlaub’s military and intelligence activities. Singlaub was an officer in the Office of Strategic Services during World War II. He became CIA deputy chief in South Korea during the Korean War and served for two years in Vietnam during the 1960s. At that time, he was commander of the Joint Unconventional Warfare Task Force, known as MACSOG. In that role, he was one of the commanders of Operation Phoenix, although he denies having had a part in that program’s infamous assassination and counterterror aspects. In 1978, as chief of staff of the United Nations Command in South Korea, he publicly condemned the decision of President Jimmy Carter to reduce the number of U.S. troops in the country. He was then forced to retire. (8,9,10) In 1984, Singlaub headed a Pentagon panel called to make recommendations on conducting military activities in Central America. The panel’s report urged the U.S. to emphasize nonconventional, counterinsurgency warfare strategies. (9,10) Under the Reagan administration, Singlaub received assistance and guidance from White House and National Security Council (NSC) officials for his \"private\" contra-supply activities. He identified former NSC aide Oliver North as his liaison to the White House. (10,18)\n\nPrivate Connections: The German affiliate is Western Goals Europe E. V. (5) This German branch is also known as the AmericanEuropean Strategy Institute. It acknowledges working with Reinhard Gehlen, a former Nazi who has been honored by the elite lay Catholic organization, the Knights of Malta (SMOM). (8) SMOM gave its highest award of honor, the Gran Croci Al Merito Conplacca, to Gehlen in l948. Gehlen, who was not a Catholic, was awarded the honor because of his efforts in the \"crusade against godless Communism.\" Gehlen headed Adolf Hitler’s spy operations against the Soviet Union during World War II. After the war, he and his spy apparatus–staffed mostly by former Nazis–were recruited by the CIA. He became the first director of the BND, West Germany’s intelligence agency. (19,26)\n\nAccording to investigative reporter Elton Manzione, J. Peter Grace was instrumental in getting John Rees into Western Goals. Grace is chairman of the Knights of Malta in the United States. (19) Grace, head of the W. R. Grace Co. , has (or had) Western Goals funder Roger Milliken on his board of directors. (8)\n\nA diagram found in Oliver North’s safe showed Linda Guell’s name written above the words \"Western Goals.\" The note on the diagram said that Guell worked with CAUSA (a political arm of the Unification Church) and its head, Bo Hi Pak, and made trips to Germany and South Korea. The word \"money\" was written over Guell’s name, with an arrow pointing to Rob Owen, North’s courier to the contras. Arrows were also drawn from Owen’s name to Guell’s and from Andy Messing–a private contra supporter and head of the National Defense Council Foundation–to Western Goals. The diagram was drawn at the bottom of a letter from Fawn Hall to \"Phil [Mabry] and Randy,\" dated April 18, 1985. (4,20) Guell is now working with John Singlaub at the Singlaub Freedom Foundation. (29)\n\nLarry McDonald, John Rees, and Sherman Unkefer were members of the John Birch Society. (8) Besides supplying intelligence to government agencies, John Rees provided information to the Wackenhut Agency, a private security company. (8) John Rees also worked with the Church League of America, another private intelligence collection group. (25)\n\nDuring the 1950s, Dan Smoot worked for Facts Forum, a political oper\n\nation of oil magnate H. L. Hunt. He left Facts Forum in 1955 to set up his own Dan Smoot Report. In that capacity, he worked with rightwing figures such as Merwin K. Hart, Gerald L. K. Smith, and Bryant Bowles. (8)\n\nHelen White, a one-time member of the advisory board of Western Goals and M. Stanton Evans, a radio broadcaster for the group, were members of the Angola \"country committee\" set up by the Council for the Defense of Freedom in the early 1980s. (10)\n\nCarl Channell has founded and headed a number of private politically oriented organizations. These include the American Conservative Trust, American Conservative Trust State Election Fund, National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty (NEPL), Sentinel, Anti-Terrorism American Committee, Channell Corporation, American Conservative Foundation, Grow Washington, and Hill Potomac. (28,31) From 1976 to 1982, he worked for the National Conservative Political Action Committee. (31) He helped organize a pro-contra fundraising dinner sponsored by the Nicaraguan Refugee Fund in 1985. (27,31) NEPL became an important fundraising link in the contra-supply network supervised by Oliver North during the period of Boland Amendment restrictions on U.S. contra support. As part of these efforts, NEPL raised funds used to purchase arms for the contras. (27,31)\n\nLt. Gen. Graham (see Govt Connections) is director of the defense lobby High Frontier. (9,14) He is also a member of the World Anti-Communist League–an organization which until recently was headed by John Singlaub. Graham is a former member of the advisory board of CAUSA USA, the political arm of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon’s Unification Church. (9,10,12,13)\n\nAs of 1983, Edward Teller was a member of the board of directors of the Committee on the Present Danger, an anticommunist organization which advocated strict containment policies vis-a-vis the Soviet Union. Other prominent members of the committee included Ronald Reagan, Jeane Kirkpatrick, and a number of individuals chosen for Reagan’s arms control negotiating teams. Altogether some 50 members of the Committee were appointed to positions in the Reagan administration during his first term. (21)\n\nJohn Singlaub, Daniel Graham, and Mildred Jefferson, are members of the national policy board of the American Freedom Coalition, a political organization with extensive ties to the Unification Church. (14,15,16,17) Singlaub, Graham, and Jefferson are/were members of the board of governors of the Council for National Policy (CNP), a secretive policy-oriented umbrella organization for the rightwing in the United States. Other\n\nWestern Goals members who are/were on the Council’s board of governors include: Sherman Unkefer, Hans Sennholz, and Robert Stoddard. The group’s financial backer Nelson Bunker Hunt is on CNP’s board too, as was Larry McDonald. (22)\n\nConnections of Funders: The Chance Foundation was set up by F. Gano Chance, a member of the John Birch Society Executive Council. Both the Grede and Ada Hearne foundations were created by members of the Birch Society as well. (8) Roger Milliken, an industrialist and union-buster, is also a member of the Birch Society. (8)\n\nMisc: When Thomas Moorer was on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he had Naval Intelligence agents tap Henry Kissinger’s phone and remove documents from Nixon’s desk. (8) John and Louise Rees infiltrated the Washington DC left community during the early 1970s. They were known by the names John Seeley and Sheila O’Conner. Between the two, they joined the National Lawyer’s Guild, the Institute for Policy Studies, and Vietnam Veterans Against the War. They formed a group called the \"Red House,\" with rent for the organization paid by the Washington DC police. (8) Edward Teller created the H-bomb. (8) Sidney Korshak and Ruby Kolod, both reputed figures in organized crime, provided funds to Larry McDonald’s political campaign. (8) McDonald once referred to Martin Luther King, Jr. as a man \"wedded to violence.\"(10) Because the plane McDonald was flying on was shot down by a Soviet fighter, his supporters have described him as \"the first victim of World War Three.\"(10)\n\nComments:U.S. Address: l33l Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Suite 376-S,\n\nWashington DC 20004 (202-662-8702).\n\nPrincipals: The following individuals were associated with the organization at some point prior to its collapse: Carl Channell (dir).

The unintended effect of the laws was to privatize the files in the hands of 'retired' intelligence officers and their most trusted, dedicated operatives.\nMany of these people, like John Rees and Congressman Larry McDonald, were members of the World Anti-Communist League, the John Birch Society, and similar organizations.

        "title": "The Koch Brothers’ Shadow: Four Decades of Influence on Conservative Politics (1980s–2025) Part 1",
        "selftext": "\n\nPart One\n\nIntroduction: Billionaire Industrialists Turned Political Architects\n\nCharles G. Koch and (until his 2019 death) David H. Koch are American billionaire industrialists who built Koch Industries into one of the largest privately held conglomerates in the world. Each brother amassed a fortune exceeding $50 billion through Koch Industries’ expansive operations in oil refining, chemicals, manufacturing, paper products, and more. With this wealth came a fervent political mission. Heirs to the ultraconservative outlook of their father (an early John Birch Society member), Charles and David embraced a libertarian philosophy centered on free markets and limited government. David Koch even ran as the Libertarian Party’s vice-presidential candidate in 1980, advocating drastic cuts to government; the ticket won only 1% of the vote. After that defeat, the Kochs shifted strategy. Rather than seeking office themselves, they leveraged their fortune to build a network of think tanks, foundations, and political groups to propagate their ideology. Over the ensuing decades, the “Kochtopus” (as critics dub it) grew into a vast extra-party political machine that rivals the Republican Party in size and influence.\n\nThe Koch network’s institutions – from the Cato Institute (a libertarian think tank Charles co-founded in 1977) to Americans for Prosperity (a grassroots advocacy group launched from a predecessor in 2004) – all push a consistent agenda. They promote laissez-faire economics: significantly lower taxes, deep cuts to social programs, deregulation of business, and the privatization of public services. The Koch organizations also crusade against organized labor and environmental regulation, key arenas where they see government overreach. In the mid-2000s, Koch-funded outfits eclipsed even ExxonMobil as the major bankrollers of climate change denial, fighting limits on carbon emissions that would affect Koch Industries’ fossil-fuel profits. Through think tanks, academic grants, campaign donations and litigation, the brothers have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to advance an arch-conservative, free-market vision of society. Liberal critics argue this fortune-fueled activism warped the American political process to favor the ultra-wealthy, undermining labor rights, public health, and the environment. Defenders contend the Kochs are simply championing “economic freedom” and prosperity for all.\n\nWhat is undeniable is the breadth of Koch influence from the 1980s through 2025. The Koch brothers helped seed the modern conservative movement’s infrastructure – funding scores of advocacy groups, academic programs, and election campaigns. They have been pivotal in shaping Republican Party platforms and right-wing policy battles at both national and state levels. This investigative exposé traces how the Kochs’ long campaign has reshaped the GOP and public policy, with special focus on their deep entanglement in Wisconsin. It draws on court filings, watchdog investigations, nonprofit records, and journalism to document the Koch network’s role in key conservative initiatives: from crushing unions and rolling back regulations to bankrolling a cadre of politicians and judges aligned with their cause. The story of the Kochs is one of private wealth projecting power through a sprawling political web, over nearly half a century.\n\nForging a Conservative Agenda on the National Stage\n\nAnti-Union Crusades and “Right-to-Work” Laws\n\nOne of the Koch brothers’ most consequential impacts has been weakening organized labor – a traditional power base of the Democratic Party. Charles and David Koch, through their flagship group Americans for Prosperity (AFP), made union-busting a top priority nationally. Their motive was both ideological (belief in free-market labor without union “interference”) and strategic (unions financially and politically bolster liberal causes). Since the 1980s, the Kochs consistently backed policies to curb union power, from President Reagan’s breaking of the air-traffic controllers’ strike to state-level battles decades later. A signature effort has been expanding “Right-to-Work” laws, which prohibit unions from requiring membership or dues as a condition of employment. Such laws undercut union finances and membership.\n\nAFP and the Koch network quietly orchestrated the spread of right-to-work legislation across former union strongholds, often via the corporate-backed American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), which produces model bills. Nowhere was this more dramatic than in the Midwest. In Michigan, a right-to-work law raced through the GOP-controlled legislature in December 2012. Behind the scenes, AFP’s Michigan chapter (heavily funded by Koch money) had agitated for years, deploying rallies, ads, and pressure on lawmakers. The final bill “mirrored the ALEC model... word for word”, and was championed by AFP and Koch allies like Amway heir Dick DeVos. Internal accounts revealed that legislative leaders were warned by Koch operatives that if they failed to enact right-to-work, they could face primary challenges and the loss of Koch donor support.\n\nWisconsin, too, saw a Koch-fueled assault on unions (detailed in Section III). In 2011, newly elected Governor Scott Walker introduced Act 10 to demolish public-sector collective bargaining rights – a surprise move conceived and promoted by the Koch-backed AFP. Massive protests erupted, but AFP spent heavily on ads and organizing to support Walker. Union strength plummeted: public-sector union membership in Wisconsin fell from ~50% in 2011 to just 19% by 2017.\n\nBy 2016, half of U.S. states had adopted right-to-work laws. AFP and Koch-funded entities actively aided these efforts in Indiana (2012), Wisconsin (2015), West Virginia (2016), and beyond. AFP’s president Tim Phillips explained the strategy: to “permanently weaken” the public-sector unions that prop up Democrats, thereby tilting the political playing field. The Koch network succeeded in rewriting the rules of labor, achieving a key piece of their libertarian vision.\n\n\nDeregulation and Climate Policy: “Government is the Problem”\n\nKoch Industries’ core businesses in oil, gas, chemicals, and manufacturing thrive under minimal regulation. Charles Koch has long waged war on agencies like the EPA. In the late 2000s, Koch-funded groups became the top funders of climate denial, surpassing ExxonMobil. They financed Heartland Institute, American Energy Alliance, and others to block regulations and sow doubt.\n\nIn 2008, AFP unveiled the “No Climate Tax Pledge”, demanding candidates never support carbon taxes. By 2010, 76 of 85 freshman GOP House members had signed. Koch PACs supported most. Legislation died, and climate action was frozen.\n\nKoch groups also promoted the REINS Act, requiring Congress to approve any major new regulation – effectively crippling regulatory agencies. States adopted versions, including Wisconsin, where Walker signed a state REINS Act. In West Virginia v. EPA (2022), a Koch-linked case, the Supreme Court limited EPA’s authority, a long-term Koch goal.\n\nIn sum, the Koch brothers used wealth and organization to disempower regulatory bodies, shift climate debates, and protect fossil fuel profits. By 2025, climate skepticism and anti-EPA sentiment had become Republican orthodoxy, thanks largely to Koch influence. ",

        "selftext": "Peter Thiel: The Billionaire Undoing Democracy, One “Thielbuck” at a Time\n\nWho he is: Peter Thiel might seem, at first glance, an unlikely comrade to the likes of Schmitt and Yarvin. He’s neither a mustachioed Prussian jurist nor a basement-dwelling blogger, but rather a natty Silicon Valley billionaire with an elite education and a penchant for contrarian bets. Thiel, born in 1967, co-founded PayPal (making his first fortune), was the first outside investor in Facebook, and later founded data-mining giant Palantir Technologies. He’s the kind of ultra-wealthy figure who could have easily confined his interests to tech start-ups and libertarian pet projects. For a while, he did: Thiel long identified as a libertarian, funding initiatives like the Seasteading Institute (which aimed to create floating city-states at sea, beyond the reach of any democracy’s laws – yes, really) and handing out grants to young people to skip college and build companies. But over time, Thiel’s political philosophy curdled into something much darker and more cynical. By the 2010s, this venture capitalist was venturing into far-right politics, railing that the twin pillars of modernity – democracy and freedom – might be incompatible, and cozying up to populist and authoritarian-leaning figures. He famously broke ranks with the tech establishment to endorse Donald Trump in 2016 (even speaking on Trump’s behalf at the Republican National Convention). And as journalists have noted, Thiel has become a chief financial patron of the new authoritarian right, bankrolling candidates and publications that share his disdain for liberal democracy.\n\nAnti-democratic credo: Peter Thiel’s journey from libertarian wunderkind to self-styled monarchist thinker is best encapsulated by one bold statement he made in 2009: *“I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.”* At the time he wrote this, Thiel was reflecting on why his libertarian ideals hadn’t triumphed in American politics. His conclusion? Democracy, by giving power to the masses, had somehow put a roadblock on freedom – or at least the kind of “freedom” Thiel values, which often looks like freedom for billionaires to do as they please. This was no offhand quip; Thiel laid it out in an essay for the Cato Institute, tracing how he’d lost faith in the ballot box. He lamented that extending voting rights (he pointed an accusatory finger at women’s suffrage, of all things) had impeded true liberty. In effect, Thiel decided that if the public won’t vote for the world he wants, then the public is the problem.\n\nOver the years, Thiel’s musings have grown only more radical and more enamored of strongman solutions. A gifted chess player in his youth, Thiel treats politics like a high-stakes game where most people are pawns, liberal institutions are cumbersome rules to be gamed or broken, and a clever few “smart CEOs” could run things much better if given absolute power. It’s no surprise, then, that Thiel gravitated toward the works of Carl Schmitt. Thiel has cited Schmitt’s concept of politics as fundamentally a battle against enemies – and the necessity of a sovereign who can declare exceptions – as insights that inform his own worldview. In a 2004 essay titled “The Straussian Moment,” Thiel quoted Schmitt extensively, agreeing that “the high point of politics” is when one can decisively identify and smite the enemy. He bemoaned that “America’s constitutional machinery” (that pesky three-branch system with its checks and balances) prevents bold action and leadership. The essay wistfully suggested that no “single ambitious person” could “reconstruct…the old republic” because of our fragmented, liberal order. Translation: The U.S. would be better off if only we could concentrate power in one set of hands – say, a tech entrepreneur turned benevolent dictator? It was a remarkably frank embrace of an illiberal idea, coming from a man who at the time was a major Republican donor and Facebook board member.\n\nThiel’s critique of democracy also intertwines with an almost millenarian view of technology and capitalism. He is deeply influenced by the late philosopher René Girard, who taught him at Stanford. Girard’s theories about mimetic desire and the role of scapegoats in society seem to have given Thiel a sense of historical grand drama – the idea that society periodically purges itself via crises and sacrificial victims. Thiel co-founded an institute with Girard and credited him with curing Thiel of *“naively individualistic…libertarianism”*. How does one leap from Girard to Schmitt? Perhaps by concluding that the old social order must sometimes be torn down for renewal, and that a charismatic leader can serve as the focal point (the katechon, to use a theological term Thiel and Schmitt both ponder – the figure who holds back chaos). Thiel speaks of political questions in almost theological terms. In a 2024 interview, he discussed the need for “political theology” and noted with a touch of admiration that “Carl Schmitt is enjoying a resurgence” in our discourse. When Thiel talks about politics, one hears an undercurrent that liberal democracy lacks a transcendent justification or unifying principle – it’s just a messy process – and thus it cannot inspire or coordinate people effectively. He’d prefer something like a shared “political religion” (ironically, since he often accuses liberals of having a secret religion of progress). In short, Thiel’s beef with democracy is that it’s too random, too egalitarian, too mediocre to tackle what he sees as civilizational challenges. Climate change? Pandemics? China? In Thiel’s view, our constitutional, deliberative system is too slow and fractured to solve them. Better to have a streamlined, hierarchical state – run by people like him and his friends, naturally – to “move fast and break things” on a civilization scale.\n\nMoney where his mouth is: It’s one thing to philosophize, but Thiel has gone further – he’s actively bankrolling and building the world he envisions. Over the past decade, Thiel has assembled what can only be described as a financial-political empire to propagate his ideas. Through his Thiel Foundation and various super-PAC donations, he’s poured tens of millions of dollars into candidates who echo his anti-establishment, anti-liberal views. In the 2022 election cycle alone, Thiel shoveled at least $10 million into super PACs for two of his protégés: J.D. Vance in Ohio and Blake Masters in Arizona. (Masters, a venture capitalist who co-wrote a book with Thiel, ran on a hard-right nationalist platform and openly questioned the merits of democracy, though he lost his race.) Both Vance and Masters were personally close to Thiel – Vance had worked for Thiel’s investment firm, and Masters managed Thiel’s family office. In essence, Thiel wasn’t just donating to random Republicans; he was grooming and deploying his own ideological lieutenants into the halls of power. These “Thiel candidates” all sang from the same hymnal: the system is broken, the elites (ironically, other elites) are corrupt, and drastic measures are needed to save America. It’s a message that rhymes with Yarvin’s teachings and Schmitt’s, merely repackaged for campaign ads.\n\nBeyond candidates, Thiel funds a web of media and thought-leader ventures. He has financed or been a key early supporter of right-leaning platforms like Palantir (which, while ostensibly apolitical, arms governments with surveillance tools – a handy thing for would-be authoritarians) and Clearview AI (controversial facial recognition tech). He reportedly backed the startup Urbit (Curtis Yarvin’s tech project) via his venture arm, giving legitimacy to Yarvin as more than just a blogger. Thiel was also an early patron of the “anti-woke” online ecosystem – investing in projects like a decentralized Twitter alternative and edge-case thinkers on the fringe. In 2022, it came to light that Thiel was a major funder behind a new right-wing journal called Compact Magazine, which flaunts a blend of social conservatism and economic populism (and has a strongly anti-liberal, pro-“strong state” bent). According to one founder, Thiel provided seed funding for Compact, alongside the chairman of the Claremont Institute (Thomas Klingenstein). While Thiel’s team denied he directly gave money, they coyly “couldn’t rule out” that maybe some Thiel-funded entity chipped in. In other words: Thiel’s money often flows through shadows and proxies, but it flows nonetheless into institutions designed to question or undermine liberal democracy from within.\n\nPerhaps the most startling example of Thiel’s willingness to wield his wealth as a weapon is the Gawker affair. Stung by the gossip blog Gawker’s rude coverage of him (they once outed him as gay and mocked his libertarian dreams), Thiel quietly plotted revenge. He secretly bankrolled a lawsuit by Hulk Hogan against Gawker that, in 2016, bankrupted the media company entirely. Thiel funneled about $10 million to finance Hogan’s case, all behind the scenes. When this covert operation came to light, Thiel framed it as an altruistic act to help “victims” of the nasty press. But it was obvious his real motive was to punish and “deter” a publication he despised. The incident sent a chill through journalists: a billionaire had proven he could litigate a free press outlet out of existence in utter secrecy. It was like a dry run for oligarchic power flexing its muscle outside democratic accountability – precisely the sort of thing one imagines a President Thiel would do on a grander scale to media he disliked. (Donald Trump, notably, later joked/complained about wanting to “open up the libel laws” to sue newspapers. With Thiel’s stunt, that threat suddenly had a playbook.)\n\nInfluence on and alignment with Trump &amp; co.: Thiel’s role in the rise of Trumpism and the new right is complex but pivotal. He was an early validator of Trump in elite circles, speaking at the 2016 RNC where most tech CEOs wouldn’t be caught dead. After Trump’s shock victory, Thiel was named to the transition team, giving input on appointments (he notably pushed some acolytes forward, though many didn’t stick). While Thiel eventually had a bit of a falling out or at least a cooling with Trump personally, by 2020-21 he was back to supporting Trumpist candidates and ideas full-throttle. He hosted fundraisers for the likes of Ken Paxton (the Texas attorney general who tried to overturn the 2020 election in court) and for organizations that deny the 2020 election results.\n\nThiel’s alignment with authoritarian-leaning figures like Trump and Vance isn’t just ideological – it’s personal and operational. He mentored Vance (Vance credits Thiel with introducing him to philosophers like Girard and turning him toward Catholic traditionalism). As mentioned, he heavily funded Vance’s Senate race and cheered as Vance reinvented himself from Trump critic to Trump’s ardent defender. Vance’s rhetoric about America needing a Caesar and being in a late-stage republic mirrors Thiel’s own lament that “we’re in a cycle reminiscent of the 1920s” – Thiel even warned of Weimar-like conditions, stating *“there are…parallels in the 2020s to Germany in the 1920s, where liberalism is exhausted… and we have to ask some questions far outside the Overton window.”* In fact, Thiel explicitly compared the U.S. to pre-Nazi Weimar Germany, suggesting democracy here may be just as “exhausted” – an extraordinarily brazen (and chilling) analogy. When a billionaire starts musing that this is Weimar and something must replace it, one might reasonably ask: what outcome is he hoping for, a new Reich? Thiel would likely smirk at the suggestion, but he’s effectively implying that drastic, extra-democratic change is needed – the kind of argument that historically has opened the door to dictators.\n\nDonald Trump, for his part, has often intuitively acted in ways that match Thiel’s Schmittian outlook. Trump’s insistence that anyone who opposes him is an enemy to be crushed (whether it’s the “fake news” media or dissenting officials) is pure friend-enemy politics. His claim that “I alone can fix it,” delivered at the 2016 RNC, could be the tagline of Thiel’s and Yarvin’s entire philosophy. During Trump’s presidency, some of Thiel’s close associates found footholds: Michael Anton (the Schmittian writer) was in the NSC; at one point, Thiel’s protege Trae Stephens was floated for a policy role. And while Trump himself is no reader of Schmitt or Yarvin, his instincts – to flout law, glorify strength, vilify “globalist” cosmopolitans, and demand personal loyalty – meshed perfectly with their theories. It’s no wonder that by Trump’s second campaign, The Guardian reported that key figures around Trump (like JD Vance as a potential VP, and some policy advisors) were explicitly “following Curtis Yarvin’s playbook” for taking power autocratically.\n\nMeanwhile, Thiel’s “Thielverse” of venture capitalists and thinkers continues to mainstream these once-fringe ideas. Take Blake Masters, Thiel’s longtime business lieutenant who ran for Senate in Arizona in 2022. Masters campaigned on themes of unchecked executive power (he floated the idea that the federal government should be brought to heel by the president, and echoed conspiracy theories about the “deep state”). His campaign rhetoric sounded like Yarvin bullet points at times – for example, he questioned why the U.S. ever let women vote (a view Thiel once hinted at too) and argued for firing masses of federal employees. Though Masters lost, he’s young and likely not done in politics. And through it all, Thiel was right there bankrolling him.\n\nThiel also holds considerable cultural sway among the Silicon Valley new right. Figures like Elon Musk (who had business overlaps with Thiel in PayPal’s early days) now also flirt with reactionary memes and antagonism to democratic norms. Musk, who invited Thiel to speak at Tesla at least once, lately sounds like he’s been reading from the Thiel/Yarvin script – ranting about elite media as propaganda, praising authoritarian responses (at one point Musk endorsed the idea of China’s president ruling for life as “stable”). It’s a loose association, but one can see how Thiel’s quiet influence helped make certain anti-democratic ideas fashionable in tech circles. He showed that you could be a world-class investor and also quote fascist-adjacent philosophers at cocktail parties – in fact, it gave you a kind of edgy glamour in some eyes. As a result, a cadre of younger techies and internet intellectuals now revere Thiel not just for his billions but for his “wisdom”. They attend salons and dinners funded by Thiel’s money where books like The Concept of the Political (by Schmitt) or blogs like Gray Mirror (by Yarvin) are the evening’s main course. Thiel has essentially nurtured a safe space for autocracy-curious elites to network and refine their talking points.\n\nWhy it matters (and why it’s alarming): In Peter Thiel, we have a living bridge between ivory-tower reactionary theory and real-world political power. He is the patron that Carl Schmitt never had (Schmitt, ironically, lacked a wealthy backer to globalize his ideas – Thiel is doing it posthumously for him). And Thiel is the enabler that Curtis Yarvin always needed – turning Yarvin’s late-night blog posts into potential legislation and administrative strategy. Thiel’s financial clout supercharges these anti-democratic ideas and spreads them far beyond obscure blogs. We often think of threats to democracy coming from angry populist mobs or power-hungry demagogues. Thiel represents a different face of the threat: the intentional, intellectual, elite-led undermining of democracy. He’s not riling up torch-bearing masses; he’s persuading billionaires, senators, and Supreme Court clerks over dinner that maybe the Enlightenment was a mistake and wouldn’t it be nice if a competent sovereign just took over. It’s a seductive pitch for a certain class of the rich and restless. After all, democracy can be so messy – wouldn’t it be more efficient if those who know better (the rich, the tech geniuses) ran things?\n\nAt the same time, let’s not paint Thiel as some omnipotent puppet master. He wins some and loses some. In 2022, one of his horses (Vance) won, another (Masters) lost. In 2023-24, he notably scaled back some political giving, possibly wary of backlash. And not every right-wing figure trusts him (some populists eye the gay, cosmopolitan tech tycoon with suspicion). But underestimate him at your peril. Thiel plays the long game. He has seeded influence in the courts (funding suits that climb to the Supreme Court), in academia (supporting programs at places like the Claremont Institute that indoctrinate young elites with Schmittian thought), and in the information sphere (funding media ventures and commentators). When you hear a well-coiffed “national conservative” intellectual on TV doubt that “democracy is appropriate for all nations” or say “maybe we need a smarter form of governance,” you’re hearing Thiel &amp; Co.’s investment yield fruit.\n\nAnd Thiel is not alone – he’s part of a broader elite network flirting with authoritarianism. For instance, he reportedly attended gatherings where scholars extol “Catholic integralism” (a theocratic authoritarian vision) and where prominent Republicans mull the end of the liberal order. He sits on the board of the Claremont Institute, a once-traditional conservative think tank that has, in recent years, produced some alarmingly illiberal work (including a notorious essay insisting the 2020 election was illegitimate and calling for countermeasures). Thiel receiving an award from Claremont and donating to it is a sign of how the respectable right’s intellectual braintrust is being nudged from within toward extremism.\n\nComic relief, Thiel edition: It’s worth injecting a bit of humor about Thiel’s almost comic-book supervillain aura. Here is a man who, dissatisfied with terrestrial politics, literally tried to build his own libertarian floating seastead in the ocean. (The project floundered – turns out even billionaires can’t easily make Waterworld a reality.) He has poured millions into anti-aging research, including, reportedly, an interest in parabiosis – injecting himself with young people’s blood – in a quest to live forever. One can’t help but make the vampire analogy: wealthy tech lord seeks youths’ blood to achieve immortality and undermine mortal governments. It sounds like the plot of a dystopian novel, yet here we are. Thiel’s eccentricities would be merely amusing if they weren’t paired with a genuine plan to reshape society. One joke circulating in Silicon Valley is that “Peter Thiel has never seen a sci-fi villain he didn’t want to become.” He named his big data firm Palantir (after the all-seeing stones in Lord of the Rings used by dark wizards), and one can only imagine he relishes the tongue-in-cheek nod. He’s aware of his cartoonish image – and he doesn’t mind; in fact, he might cultivate it a bit as part of his contrarian brand. After all, when confronted about undermining Gawker through secret lawsuits, he coolly said it was *“less about revenge and more about deterrence”*, a line that could be straight out of a Bond villain’s monologue. Thiel’s combination of massive wealth, secretive strategies, and disdain for the common will does make him fun to portray as a nefarious schemer in jokes. But unlike a comic book character, Thiel is very real, and so are the candidates he elects and the policies they push.\n\nTo cap the comedy: Recently, a left-wing wag quipped that people like Thiel (and his ally Klingenstein at Claremont) *“should be robbed of all of their money by a mob of poor people.”* It was a crude joke born of frustration – essentially saying, if these oligarchs hate democracy, fine, let’s give them a taste of actual mob rule. Of course, no such mob is coming for Thiel’s billions anytime soon. Instead, Thiel continues to sit atop his hoard, plotting how to use it to ensure the rest of us end up with less say in our government. He’s proof that being extremely rich can give you both the motive and the means to indulge very undemocratic fantasies about how society should be run.\n\nThe Triumvirate’s Grand Design – and Why It’s Dangerous\n\nBringing together our three protagonists – Schmitt the philosopher of crisis and dictatorship, Yarvin the internet-savvy monarchist, and Thiel the bankroll behind the throne – we see a coherent ideology emerge. It is a worldview that says: Liberal democracy has had its day. The experiment of the Enlightenment, of government by the people, of equality under the law – that was a cute interlude, but it’s failing. In its place, they propose a return to older principles: hierarchy, sovereignty, the rule of the few (or the one) over the many. They don’t necessarily agree on who should be sovereign – Schmitt favored a decisive statesman (or Führer, in his context), Yarvin wants a tech CEO monarch, Thiel perhaps imagines a class of visionary billionaires – but they all agree it shouldn’t be the voters at large. They variously malign what Schmitt called *“impotent pluralism”* – the messy compromise-building of liberal politics – and yearn for the efficiency of unified command.\n\nTheir ideas have cross-pollinated in interesting ways. Yarvin, though he seldom cites Schmitt by name on his blog, echoes Schmittian themes: the obsession with identifying an ultimate enemy or oppressor (Yarvin’s “Cathedral” is essentially Schmitt’s enemy in modern garb), the contempt for proceduralism, the acceptance that might makes right when refounding a regime. And Yarvin explicitly advocates the “state of exception” that Schmitt justified – when he calls for burning the Constitution or terminating every government employee, he’s saying we need an extra-legal rupture to save America (precisely Schmitt’s prescription for Weimar). Thiel, in turn, has one foot in Yarvin’s world and one in Schmitt’s. Thiel provides Yarvin with real avenues to influence (funding and friendships) and amplifies Yarvin’s attacks on the status quo. Meanwhile, Thiel reads Schmitt to intellectually arm himself – he can quote the master’s articulation of why liberal democracy must be swept aside, giving a high-brow veneer to what might otherwise sound like tech bro griping. Thiel essentially operationalizes these philosophies: he identifies candidates who can carry them out, he funds literature and groups that sanitize them for public consumption, and he even mimics the strategies (using exceptions to the law, e.g. in the Gawker case, to achieve his will).\n\nThe significance in today’s politics cannot be overstated. We are witnessing an infusion of once-taboo authoritarian thought directly into the bloodstream of the Republican Party and conservative movement. It’s not happening through a mass fascist party with armbands, but through elite channels – through think tanks, millionaire donors, high-brow magazines, and influential blogs. This is a key point: historically, many anti-democratic revolutions were bottom-up (angry mobs, military coups). Here we have something more like a trickle-down autocracy: extremely educated or wealthy figures persuading and financing the political class to turn against liberal democracy. It’s cocktail parties at Georgetown brownstones and Silicon Valley mansions where guests earnestly debate “maybe we should have a king.” It’s Ivy League graduates in Senate offices reading blogs titled “Unqualified Reservations.” It’s a United States Senator (Vance) publicly saying democracy might just be past its prime. As bizarre as it sounds, this elite-driven movement has made tangible strides. Just consider policy: a concept like Schedule F (firing tens of thousands of civil servants to concentrate power) would have been unthinkable a few years ago. Now it’s on the policy agenda for a potential second Trump term. Or look at rhetoric: ten years ago, if a major political figure called the press the “enemy of the people” or openly floated ignoring court rulings, it would be a career-ending scandal. Today, it’s practically a plank in the platform – cheered on by those who see the press as the Cathedral’s minions and the courts as annoyances to a strong executive.\n\nAnother crucial piece of context: the alignment with authoritarian-leaning figures like Donald Trump is both opportunistic and ideological. For Schmitt, hitching his wagon to a brute like Hitler was opportunism (he needed a strongman to prove his theories right, and unfortunately he found one). For Yarvin and Thiel, Trump initially seemed an imperfect vessel – not exactly the philosopher-king type, more a bombastic populist. Yet they supported him because he was, in effect, a wrecking ball against the liberal order they despise. Yarvin described Trump in 2016 as a “vulgar clown” but appreciated that Trump disrupted the Cathedral’s smooth operation. Thiel, though reportedly wary of Trump’s undisciplined style, saw Trump as a step toward breaking the consensus. By 2020, Thiel’s investments in people like Vance indicate he wants Trumpism 2.0: a smarter, more ideologically coherent authoritarianism – Trumpism with brains and a plan. Vance and others provide the intellectual veneer and discipline that Trump lacked, while still riding Trump’s populist appeal. In effect, the Schmitt-Yarvin-Thiel camp is trying to engineer an American Caesar who combines populist energy (a mass base) with elite revolutionary know-how (their guidance). It’s a potent combination if it ever fully gels: imagine a future president with Trump’s demagogic skills, Yarvin’s playbook, and Thiel’s money and ruthlessness. That is what keeps liberal democracy watchdogs up at night.\n\nThe danger of these ideas is not just theoretical. If implemented, they would mean the end of the American experiment as we know it. We’re talking about openly discarding constitutional constraints, eliminating checks and balances, and ruling by fiat. History teaches that when regimes go down that road, the outcome is repression and misery – from Weimar’s end in 1933 to countless coups in developing nations. Schmitt would remind us (perhaps with a cold smile) that yes, liberal democracy can die this way, and that sometimes people even cheer its demise in the moment because they’ve been convinced it’s the only way to survive a crisis. What crisis do our trio cite? For Schmitt it was the instability of Weimar and the threat of communists; for Yarvin, it’s the “decadence” and “decay” of modern America; for Thiel, it’s the stagnation of the West and external threats like China. They’re all selling the notion that extraordinary times justify extraordinary measures. It’s a seductive rationale – just let a strong sovereign do what needs doing, and don’t worry about the finer points of legality or consent.\n\nThe irony, of course, is that all three of these figures enjoy the fruits of the liberal order even as they decry it. Schmitt only could pontificate in Weimar’s relative freedom (the Nazis happily used him until he became inconvenient). Yarvin could only thrive by spreading his message via free internet platforms and a society tolerant of dissent (had he tried his antics under an actual monarchy, he might have been jailed for sedition against the king!). Thiel made his billions in the very climate of open markets, property rights, and rule of law that liberal democracy provides – and used freedoms (like the legal system and free speech) to advance his attack on those same freedoms. They are, in a sense, parasites on liberalism – feeding off it, growing strong, and then attempting to kill it. As a bit of dark humor: it’s like a trio of well-fed dinner guests loudly arguing that the host should be poisoned, all while enjoying the host’s wine and cheese.\n\nYet, despite that hypocrisy, the threat is real because these men are not alone. They have followers, they have allies, and they have momentum. Schmitt’s books are studied by a new generation of nationalist academics who provide papers and policy whitepapers for Republican officials. Yarvin’s memes and terminologies (“red-pilling,” “the Cathedral,” “grey mirror”) permeate online discourse among young conservatives and nihilistic tech forums. Thiel’s candidates and their fellow travelers increasingly populate Congress and governorships, forming a cadre willing to disregard democratic norms (we saw on January 6, 2021, what that can lead to, when a chunk of Congress tried to overturn an election and mobs stormed the Capitol – an event some of our trio’s fans frankly cheered as the “storming of the Cathedral”). It’s telling that Thiel’s money has also gone to state attorneys general and election skeptics – positions that could help tilt the machinery of voting and law in anti-democratic directions.\n\nIn closing this first part of our exposé, the reader should take away a clear message: the anti-democratic ideology that Schmitt espoused, Yarvin popularized, and Thiel bankrolled is no longer confined to theoretical musings. It is knocking on the door of power. Its advocates are already inside the room, in some cases. They don’t wear obvious labels like “fascist” (that would be too gauche, and they prefer to think of themselves as innovative, not antiquated 20th-century throwbacks). Instead, they talk of “rethinking democracy,” “post-liberal order,” “CEO government,” or “national conservatism.” These euphemisms shouldn’t fool anyone. Underneath, the aim is the same: to concentrate power in the hands of a few deemed superior (by wealth, birth, or intellect), and to remove the checks that protect the many.\n\nWe can and will find humor in skewering their pretensions – indeed, one must laugh at the image of billionaires earnestly reading monarchist tracts in secret dinners, or bloggers fantasizing about being court jesters to a future King of America. There’s rich comedy in Thiel’s quest for eternal life or Yarvin’s nerdy revolution. But we mustn’t let the laughter obscure the stakes. As the saying (often misattributed to Schmitt’s contemporary) goes, “When fascism comes to America, it will come wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross.” Perhaps. Or maybe it will come wrapped in a Stanford hoodie and carrying a venture capital check, smiling as it assures us it just wants to “make America run like a start-up.” Either way, it would be no joke.\n\nEnd of Part One. In the next installment of this series, we will delve deeper into how these anti-democratic ideas are being operationalized through political networks, media narratives, and policy proposals – examining the wider cast of characters and institutions that are midwifing this elite-driven authoritarian resurgence. For now, consider the stage set and the main actors introduced. The stakes? Nothing short of the future of American democracy.\n\nSources: The assertions and quotes in this report are drawn from a range of credible public sources, including scholarly analyses, reputable news outlets, and the figures’ own writings and speeches. Carl Schmitt’s role and philosophy are documented by both academic commentary and historical accounts. Curtis Yarvin’s statements and influence are well chronicled in interviews and profiles from Vanity Fair, The Guardian, The Verge, and others. Peter Thiel’s quotes and political dealings have been reported in outlets like Cato Unbound, Reason, The New York Times, Vanity Fair, and Politico. Specific claims – such as Thiel funding the Hulk Hogan lawsuit, or Vance’s “late republican period” remarks – are backed by reporting in The Guardian and Politico, respectively. Each embedded citation in the text points to the source verifying the adjacent claim or quote. By stitching these sources together, we get a verifiable picture of how these three men and their ideas converge to challenge the very premises of liberal democracy in America.\n\n",

Charles, the second oldest of the four brothers, pressured Fred Jr. to turn over his shares of the family company to his three younger brothers. Otherwise, Charles would expose Fred Jr. as a homosexual to their father, injuring his health and resulting in Fred Jr.’s disinheritance [58]\n\nAbout 16 years later, in 1983, Charles and David bought out their two other brothers’ shares for about $1.1 billion to become 80% owners of Koch Industries, split evenly. But fraternal litigation continued for 17 more years. [61]\n\nAfter the 1962 publication of Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring, exposing the devastating environmental fallout from irresponsible chemical practices, Congress passed the **Clean Air Act**, the **Clean Water Act**, the **Toxic Substances Control Act**, and other laws creating the modern regulatory state. [90] In 1970, legislation created the **Environmental Protection Agency** and the **Occupational Safety and Health Administration**. In developing regulations, the EPA was directed to weigh only one concern - public health. Costs to industry were deemed irrelevant. [90]\n\nCharles transformed his private foundation into the **Cato Institute** [date? 106], giving $10-20 million of tax-deductible donations over its first 3 years to the nation’s first libertarian think tank. [106] Ed Crane, Cato’s president, “would always call Wichita and run everything by Charles. It was quite clear that Koch was in charge.” [107]\n\n&gt; Ed Crane quotes his conversation with Charles Koch to start the Cato Institute, “I said my bank account was empty. He said, ‘How much do you need?’ [Crane:] ’A libertarian think tank along the model of Brookings or AEI might be nice’. [Koch:] ’I’ll give it to you’.” [107]\n\n## Owner (sole?) of **Koch Industries**\n \nSecond largest private company in America \nOwning: [5]\nfour thousand miles of pipelines [5]\noil refineries in Alaska, Texas and Minnesota [5]\nthe Georgia-Pacific lumber and paper company [5]\ncoal [5] (the C. Reiss Coal Company [264]\nchemicals [5]\nFertilizer, petroleum coke manufacturing, timber, leases on over a million acres of untapped Canadian oil sands [264]\nhuge traders in commodities futures [5]\n\n### His father Fred Koch became rich by building oil refineries for the Stalin and Hitler regimes in the 1930s [34-37]\n\nBy 1975, the government had charged the company with violating federal oil price controls and overcharging $10 million for propane gas. [106]\n\nIn 1989, the U.S. Senate released a scathing report accusing Koch of “a widespread and sophisticated scheme to steal crude oil from Indians and others through fraudulent mis-measuring”. [159] Senate investigators said “It wasn’t like politics; it was like investigating organized crime”. [160] One witness noted, “They’ve got more money than many small countries do” [161] The report was the result of other oil companies secretly turning Koch in for cheating, since they did not have substantial measurement problems. [159]\n\nIn 1995, the Justice Department sued Koch for lying about leaking millions of gallons of oil from its pipelines and storage facilities in 6 different states. [154] Federal investigators documented over 300 oil spills during the previous 5 years, including one 100,000 gallon crude oil spill that left a 12 mile long slick in the bay off of Corpus Christi, not far from the Koch refinery. [154] Angela O’Connell, the lead federal prosecutor, suspected her trash was being searched and her phone bugged, but in the end, she prevailed when Koch Industries agreed to pay a $30 million fine, the biggest in history to that point, for violations of the Clean Water Act. [154-155]\n\nIn 1999, the jury awarded plaintiff Danny Smalley almost three times his requested $100 million in damages for the death of his daughter from the explosion of butane gas from one of Koch’s corroded pipelines, $296 million - the largest wrongful death award on record. [156-159]\nAfter the 1989 Senate report, Bill Koch, the youngest Koch brother, was told by one news outlet that his two older brothers could go to jail but replied “Then lock ‘em up! I did not want my family, my legacy, my father’s legacy, to be based on organized crime.” [161] He had sued his brothers for allegedly deliberately undervaluing the company and cheating him of his fair share of the family fortune. [162] So after the following criminal prosecution failed, Bill filed a whistle-blower lawsuit under the False Claims Act against Koch Industries [163-164] and found a former employee who worked his way up from a “gauger” measuring crude oil when buying from suppliers to senior management, Phil Dubose, to take the stand about “the Koch Method” who testified:\n\n&gt; “They were just mis-measuring crude oil from the Indian reservations as they did all over the U.S. If you bought crude, you’d shorten the gauge. They’d show you how. They had meters in the field. They’d recalibrate them, so if it showed a barrel, they’d say it was just three-quarters of a barrel when they were buying it. You did it in different ways. You cheated. If we sold a barge with fifteen hundred barrels, you’d say it was two thousand. It all involved weights and measurements, and they had their thumb on the scale. That was the Koch Method.” [166]\n\n&gt; “The Kochs never did play by the rules. They had their own playing field. They just didn’t abide by anything. Not the EPA or anything else. They constantly polluted. If they got fined, it didn’t matter because they made so much money doing it. We never reported things like busted pipeline out in the field. Otherwise, we’d get fined. When we spilled oil, we never reported the real amount. We were told to do that, to keep our costs down. The Kochs expected us to lie and try to cover it up.” [167] A book, Sons of Wichita by Daniel Schulman, details their serial lawbreaking. [154]\n\n&gt; “You don’t have to be a genius like Bill Gates to make money the way they did. They just did it by breaking the rules all over the country.” [167]\n\nWhen the lawsuit settled for $25 million (less than the potential $200 million) with most going to the federal government and a quarter going to Bill plus his legal fees, Dubose said, “It was the first time they were defeated. We won because they didn’t have a weapon as big as the one we used. The truth.” [168]\n\nBy mid-2001 the warring brothers reached a ceasefire known as the “global settlement”, where Charles, David, and Bill agreed to no further litigation and a binding non-disparagement clause that imposed hefty escalating financial penalties for violations. [168]\n\n### EPA ranked Koch Industries as one of only three companies in America that was simultaneously a top ten polluter of air, water and climate [date? xiv]\n\nKoch Industries alone routinely released some 24 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere a year. [264]\n\n### In 2010, despite some improvement, Koch Industries was still rated one of the top ten air polluters in the United States, by Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. [168]\n\n### In 2012, the EPA’s database revealed Koch Industries was the #1 producer of toxic waste - 950 million pounds. [168-169], [338] It also released 56.8 million pounds of hazardous materials into the air, water, and soil, making it the country’s 5th largest polluter. [338]\n\nAfter the lawsuits and prosecutions, the Kochs sold off many of their most troublesome pipelines, paring their holdings down to 4000 miles, and moved heavily into the finance sector, trading commodities and derivatives, where regulations and oversight were weaker. [169] They diversified rapidly, acquiring DuPont’s synthetic textile division, Invest, for $4.1 billion in 2004, making them the world’s producers of Lycra and other well-known brands such as StainMaster carpet. [169] In 2005, they bought out Georgia-Pacific, the huge wood-products company, for $21 billion, making them one of the world’s biggest manufacturers of plywood, laminates, and ubiquitous paper products like Dixie cups, Brawny paper towels, and Quilted Northern toilet paper, as well as a major producer of formaldehyde. [169]\n\n# **The Koch network, Kochtopus, most donors in the top .1% or higher of the nation’s wealthiest citizens** [8]\n\n### Coal, oil, and gas magnates formed the nucleus of the Koch donor network. [246]\n\n### Koch donors are mostly private owners of their businesses with no requirements for public disclosures to shareholders [22]\n\n### The Koch summits for conservative donors twice a year started in 2003 [10], mainly to oppose any government action on climate change that would hurt their profits [11]; most agreed on opposing government regulation and taxation. [16]\nThe summits began with 15 people in 2003 to include 18 billionaires in 2015 who alone were worth more than $214 billion [13] and about 400 of the richest people in the country [10-16?]\n\n### 2016, bigger payroll than the Republican National Committee, with the aim of targeting 5 million voters in 8 states with key Senate races, to keep both houses of Congress under conservative Republican control and then to continue the sweep of state and local legislatures that began in 2010 [xvii] in Texas alone, 74 different races including county court commissioner [xviii]\n1,600 paid staffers in 35 states to cover 80% of the population [xvii]\n\n# **Richard Mellon Scaife**, heir to the Mellon banking and Gulf Oil fortunes [6] and Alcoa aluminum [73]\n\nScaife’s memoir estimates that he helped bankroll at least 133 of the conservative movement’s 300 most important institutions. [93]\n\nIn 1975, the Scaife Family Charitable Trust gave $195,000 to the new conservative think tank in Washington started in 1973 whose first donor was Joseph Coors, a scion of the archconservative Colorado-based Coors brewery family, the **Heritage Foundation**. From 1975-1985, Scaife became its largest backer, donating $10 million more [93] and by 1988, their donations totaled $23 million. [93]\n\nPreviously, Scaife had been the largest donor to the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), the older, rival conservative think tank in Washington but preferred a research center that would actively lobby members of Congress before decisions were made instead of worrying about its nonprofit status [94]\n\nUnlike traditional research institutes e.g. the Brookings Institution, founded in 1916, whose mission was to be “free from any political or pecuniary interest” and mandated that scholars of many viewpoints populate its board [96], the Heritage Foundation prided itself on creating, selling, and injecting deeply conservative ideas into the American mainstream. [94]\n\nOliver Smedley, cofounder of the grandfather of libertarian think tanks in London, the Institute of Economic Affairs as well as the Manhattan Institute in New York, said it was “imperative that we should give no indication in our literature that we are working to educate the public along certain lines which might be interpreted as having a political bias. In other words, if we said openly that we were re-teaching the economics of the free market, it might enable our enemies to question the charitableness of our motives”. [97]\n\nInstead in the 1970s, they would accuse existing establishment organizations committed to neutrality and public service like Brookings and the New York Times of equal “bias” in favor of the public interest and being liberal. [99]\n\n&gt; “They introduced doubt into areas of settled academic and scientific scholarship, undermined genuinely unbiased experts [100] and gave politicians a menu of conflicting statistics and arguments from which to choose” [100] … The hazard … was that partisan shills would create “balance” based on fraudulent research and deceive the public about pressing issues in which their sponsors had financial interests.” [100] \n\nBy the 1980s, Heritage Foundation’s other sponsors included Fortune 500 companies such as Amoco, Amway, Boeing, Chase Manhattan Bank, Chevron, Dow Chemical, Exxon, General Electric, General Motors, Mesa Petroleum, Mobil Oil, Pfizer, Philip Morris, Proctor &amp; Gamble, R. J. Reynolds, Searle, Sears, Roebuck, SmithKline Beckman, Union Carbide, and Union Pacific. [108]\n\n### By the early 1980s, the reversal of public opinion was so significant that Americans’ distrust of government for the first time surpassed their distrust of business. [108]\n\nBy 1985, the Heritage Foundation’s budget equaled that of Brookings and AEI combined. [111] Scaife, whose total by then was $10 million, was contributing $1 million per year. [111]\nPaul Weyrich, cofounder of the Heritage Foundation, [94] created the Republican Study Committee, a caucus where the Heritage Foundation was the only outsider to caucus with Republican members of Congress. [108]\n\nWeyrich also created the **American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC)**, a group aimed at waging conservative fights in every state legislature in the country. [109]\n\nFrom 1973-1983, the Scaife and Mellon family trusts donated $500,000 to ALEC, constituting most of its budget. [109]\n\n### The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), created by Paul Weyrich, cofounder of the Heritage Foundation in the 1970’s [109], became a conservative corporate “bill mill” where thousands of businesses and trade groups paid expensive dues to attend closed-door conferences with local officials where they drafted model legislation that state legislators subsequently introduced as their own. [425-426] On average, ALEC produced about 1000 new bills a year, some 200 of which became state law. [426] ALEC was almost indistinguishable from a corporate lobbying operation, but defined itself as a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) “educational” organization. [426] For years, among ALEC’s most active members was the for-profit prison industry. [426] In 1995, ALEC began promoting mandatory-minimum sentences for drug offenses. [426] Two years later, Charles Koch bailed ALEC out financially with a $430,000 loan. [426]\n\nWeyrich cofounded “The Moral Majority” with Jerry Falwell, which brought social and religious conservatives into the pro-corporate fold. [110]\n\nReagan delivered 61% of Heritage’s 1,270 policy proposals from its policy playbook, Mandate for Leadership. [110]\n\nBetween 1981-1986, the top income tax was cut from 70% to 28%. Meanwhile, taxes on the bottom 4/5 rose. Economic inequality, which had flatlined, began to climb. [111]\n\n# **John M. Olin**, chemical and munitions company titan [6] and Cornell graduate and former trustee [112]\n\nThe Olin Corporation began in East Alton, Illinois in 1892 as a manufacturer of blasting powder for coal miners and then expanded into making small arms and ammunition, quintupling its revenues due to WWI and WWII due to its huge government contracts e.g. $40 million in profits from WWII alone. [115] After a 1954 merger with the Mathieson Chemical Corporation, it made everything from pharmaceuticals in its Squibb division to Winchester rifles and the hydrazine rocket fuel powering Neil Armstrong’s 1969 lunar landing. [116] \n\nBut by 1973, the Olin Corporation was embroiled in serious, expensive litigation over its environmental practices [115] such as its production of DDT, of which it supplied 20% of the US total [116]. \n\nIn 1970, the New York Times reported that the U.S. Interior Department charged the Olin Corporation with dumping 26.6 pounds of mercury a day into the Niagara River in upstate New York. [117] Three former corporate officers were convicted of falsifying records in the case and the judge imposed the maximum available fine of $70,000. [117] \nHowever, Olin Corporation’s pollution was so extensive and intractable that it faced the prospect of tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars in cleanup costs, with no end in sight. [118]\n\nIn Saltville, one of its company towns in Virginia, the company estimated it dumped about 100 pounds of mercury a day into public waterways from 1951-1970. [118] The cost of cleaning up Saltville was projected to be upwards of $35 million. [121] Facing increasing competition, battles with the United Mine Workers and new 1970 Virginia standards that it couldn’t meet, the Olin Corporation shut down the plant in 1972 and sold most of its real estate [119-120]. Soon after, the EPA designated Saltville one of the country’s first “Superfund” sites.\n\n### The Olin Foundation underwrote 83% of the costs of all “Law and Economics” programs in American law schools, including Harvard, Yale, Chicago, Columbia, Cornell, Georgetown and the University of Virginia - a new approach to jurisprudence known as which stressed the need to analyze laws, including regulations, not just for fairness but also for their economic impact. [130-131] Other donations included an $18 million donation for the John M. Olin Center for Law, Economics, and Business at Harvard Law School [132] and $5.5 million in start up funds, along with other donors such as foundations tied to Scaife and the Kochs, for the Federalist Society in 1982, a powerful professional network of 42,000 right-leaning lawyers, across 150 law school campuses. [134]\n\n# **Harry and Lynde Bradley**, midwesterners enriched by defense contracts [6]\n\nThe Allen-Bradley company was a Milwaukee electronic manufacturer, which relied on government defense contracts for 70% of its business, with its business volume tripling during WWII. [141] It was bought by Rockwell International, America’s largest defense contractor, for $1.6 billion in cash.[140]\n\nThis 1985 merger turned the assets of the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation from $14 million to over $290 million overnight, making it one of the 20 largest foundations in the country. [137]\n\n2/3rd of its grants financed conservative intellectual activity from 600 graduate and post-graduate fellowships, right wing think tanks, conservative journals, and its own publishing house, Encounter Books. [138]\n\nThanks to smart investments, by 2012, the Bradley Foundation’s assets reached over $630 million, enabling more than $32 million in grants that year alone [144] such as $250,000 Bradley Prizes for stars of the movement such as Fox News president, Roger Ailes. [144-145] \nThe Bradley Foundation added Diane Hendricks and Art Pope to its board.

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI wanted to share a detailed explanation of what happened after Citizens United to show the level of political strategy, rule testing and game playing that needs to be understood in order to combat these efforts. \n\nThis is my third post summarizing details from Dark Money by Jane Mayer. It’s a 10 year old book but I’m finding that there are still a lot of people that haven’t appreciated her detailed research in laying the whole situation out. My previous post is linked above, which links the post before that. Thanks for reading!\n\n\n### On January 21, 2010, the Court announced its 5-4 decision in the **Citizens United** case, overturning a century of restrictions banning corporations and unions from unlimited spending on political candidates, as long as the money was to outside groups that were technically independent. To reach the verdicts, the Court accepted the argument that corporations had the same right to free speech as citizens, preceded by **SpeechNow** which overturned the same limits for individuals as well. [280] \n\nBradley Smith, leader of the SpeechNow suit, also founded the Center for Competitive Politics, conservative group. [292] Smith was a radically anti regulatory lawyer who pushed for zero public disclosure of political spending. [292] IRS records showed that in 2009 his center was supported by several conservative foundations including the Bradley Foundation [292] The Institute of Justice was also involved. [292-293]\n\nThe SpeechNow litigation was heavily underwritten by Fred Young, a libertarian retiree in Wisconsin who made tens of millions of dollars by selling his father’s firm, Young Radiator Company, after outsourcing the jobs of unionized workers to non-union states. Young served on the boards of the Koch-backed Reason Foundation and Cato Institute and was a regular attendee at the Kochs’ donor summits. [293]\n\nGeorge Soros [6], New York hedge fund magnate, who funneled more than $27 million into outside spending groups known as 527 groups prior to Citizens United, and threatened to spend his $7 billion fortune on defeating President Bush for his invasion of Iraq, withdrew from spectacular campaign funds after the Federal Election Commission fined both Democrats and Republicans for violations but remained an active donor, spending hundreds of millions on a network of human rights and civil liberties groups [290]\n\nAfter Citizens United, Fred Young contributed 80% of the money spent in 2010 by SpeechNow.org's super PAC, including TV ads targeting Wisconsin Democratic senator Russ Feingold, the Senate’s premier supporter of strict campaign spending laws, who urged outside groups not to spend on his behalf and who was defeated [293]\n\nThe budget for Kochs’ flagship group, Americans for Prosperity (AFP) and its foundation went from $2 million in 2004 and $15.2 million in 2008 to $40 million in 2010. [309]\n\n# The Koch donor summits went from $13 million in June 2009 to almost $900 million at a single fundraising session in the years that followed. [293]\n\n## In 2006, only 2% of “outside” political spending came from “social welfare” groups that hid their donors. [305] In 2010, this rose to 40%, masking hundreds of millions of dollars. [305] \n\nFor the 2014 elections, the Koch network poured over $100 million into competitive races and almost twice that into other kinds of activism. [455] The largest disclosed donor in 2014 was Tom Steyer, the California hedge fund magnate turned environmental activist, with $74 million trying to elect candidates who pledged to fight global warming. [455] But the 100 biggest known donors in 2014 spent nearly as much money as the 4.75 million who contributed $200 or less, giving $323 million of disclosed money, not including the millions in unlimited, undisclosed money. [455] \n\n# During the five years before a 2015 interview, the Koch network had contributed over $760 million to mysterious and ostensibly apolitical nonprofits such as the Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, the Center to Protect Patient Rights, and the TC4 Trust. [456] \n\n**While amassing one of the most lucrative fortunes in the world, the Kochs had also created an ideological assembly line justifying it. Now they had added a powerful political machine to protect it. They had hired top-level operatives, financed their own voter data bank, commissioned state-of-the-art polling, and created a fund-raising operation that enlisted hundreds of other wealthy Americans to help pay for it. They had also forged a coalition of some 17 allied conservative groups with niche constituencies who would mask their centralized source of funding and carry their message. To mobilize Latino voters, they formed a group called the Libre Initiative. To reach conservative women, they funded the Concerned Women for America. For millennials, they formed Generation Opportunity. To cover up fingerprints on television attack ads, they hid behind the American Future Fund and other front groups. Their network’s money also flowed to gun groups, retirees, veterans, antilabor groups, antitax groups, evangelical Christian groups, and even $4.5 million for something called the Center for Shared Services, which coordinated tasks such as office space rentals and paperwork for the others. Americans for Prosperity (AFP), meanwhile, organized chapters all across the country. The Kochs had established what was in effect their own private political party. ** ***Secrecy permeated every level of the operation. One former Koch executive, Ben Pratt, who became the chief operating officer of the voter data bank, Themis, used a quotation from Salvador Dali on his personal blog that could have served as the enterprise’s motto: “The secret of my influence is that it has always remained a secret.” [384-385]***\n\nA former Democrat, Ed Gillespie, was a top national political tactician who became the chairman of the Republican National Committee in 2003 at the age of 41 and who, as founder of Quinn Gillespie &amp; Associates, a bipartisan lobbying firm, made as much as $19 million. [297] Within weeks of Citizens United, Gillespie met Karl Rove, his fellow Bush White House alumnus, to plan a new shadow political machine. [297] \n\n### With Obama dominating Washington, Gillespie looked to the states. [298] He knew that 2011 was a year in which many state legislatures would redraw the boundaries of their congressional districts based on a new census, a process that only took place once a decade. [298] So he aimed at a Republican takeover of governorships and legislatures across the country. [298] Then Republicans could redraw their states’ congressional districts in order to favor their candidates. [298] While the mechanics of state legislative races were abstruse and deadly dull to most people, to Gillespie, they were the key to a Republican comeback. \n\n[298] Gillespie called the plan **“REDMAP” an acronym for the Redistricting Majority Project**. [298] To implement it, he took over the **Republican State Leadership Committee (RSLC)**, a nonprofit group that had previously functioned as a catchall bank account for corporations interested in influencing state laws. [298] All he needed was the money to put REDMAP into action and he got it by the end of 2010 - million dollar donations from tobacco companies Altria and Reynolds and huge donations from Walmart, the pharmaceutical industry, and donors like those at the Koch summit, adding up to $30 million, 3x its Democratic counterpart. [299]\n\nA second man for the new political operation was James Arthur “Art” Pope, a charter member of the Koch network, regular attendee of the Kochs’ secret planning summits, board member of both CSE and its successor AFP, [299] multimillionaire chairman and CEO of Variety Wholesalers, a family-owned discount-store conglomerate with hundreds of outlets up and down the mid-Atlantic and the South, with a seemingly inexhaustible command of political minutiae [299], who served up his home state of North Carolina, historically a pivotal swing state as a test case for REDMAP. [300] \n\nObama had carried it narrowly in 2008 and remained popular in 2010. [300] Democrats dominated the state legislature; Republicans hadn’t controlled both houses of the North Carolina General Assembly for more than 100 years. [300] “Not since General Sherman”, the joke went. [300] Bob Geary, a political reporter for the Indy Week, an alternative newspaper in Durham, described him in his run for lieutenant governor in 1992 as “a terrible candidate … very introverted and pedantic”, but he was a master of arcane election law. [300]\n\nIn the previous decade, Pope, his family and the family foundation had spent more than $40 million on pushing politics to the right. [299] Pope had given money to at least 27 of the groups supported by the Kochs, including organizations opposing environmental regulations, tax increases, unions, and campaign spending limits, such as the James Madison Center for Free Speech. [300]\n\nA third man for the new political operation was Jim Ellis, former “right-hand man” and executive director of his PAC, to Tom DeLay, the powerful House Republican leader from Texas who was infamous for his “K Street operation” which serviced corporate lobbyists while shaking them down for campaign contributions, who had a history of creating fake movements in support of unpopular corporations and causes [301]. \n\nMeanwhile, Randy Kendrick, wife of Koch donor Earl “Ken” Kendrick, a West Virginian millionaire who founded Datatel, a computer software provider for colleges and universities, incorporated the **Center to Protect Patient Rights (CPPR)** on April 16, 2009 together with Sean Noble, her de facto political consultant, to oppose government healthcare and the **Affordable Care Act (ACA)** in particular [230-231].\n\nThe House passed the Affordable Care Act (ACA), despite nasty Tea Party protests e.g. Tim Phillips, AFP’s president, organized a “Kill the Bill” protest on Capitol Hill accusing the Democrats of “trying to cram this 2,000 page bill down the throats of the American people” and a second Capitol Hill protest a few days later where protesters spat on a passing Democratic congressman, called Barney Frank, a gay representative from Massachusetts, a “faggot”, and shouted racist epithets at three black congressmen, John Lewis, Emanuel Cleaver, and Jim Cleaver). [302-303] In response to the ACA’s win in the House, Noble and other Koch operatives focused on taking over the House. [302-303] \n\nFunding for Noble’s CPPR quadrupled by the end of 2010 to $61.8 million. As with all such 501(c)(4) dark money [230] “social welfare” groups, under the tax code, the sources of its funding didn’t have to be publicly disclosed. [304] Another Koch-tied group, **TC4 Trust**, raised $42.7 million that year and routed 1/3 of that to CPPR through a method disguised on disclosure forms, bringing Sean Noble’s kitty up to almost $75 million. [304] \n\nTC4 defined itself as a free-market advocacy group whose “grant funds shall not be used for political activity” [353] but it soon was paying for polling and a public advocacy program aimed at shaping and selling the Republican budget. [353] \n\n&gt; Ed Goeas, the president of the Tarrance Group, a Republican polling company that worked on the budget project, said, “It wasn’t about developing policy, it was about selling it.” [353] The solution was to avoid using the word “cut” when talking about Medicare or Social Security. “There were discussion that you could deal with it as ‘getting your money’s worth out of the government’. You could talk about it as ‘more effective’ - but not as cutting it. It had to be about efficiencies’. That was a large part of it.” [353]\n\nPublic Notice, one of the Koch Brothers’ groups according to Goeas, paid for the research and a public advocacy campaign describing the deficit as a looming catastrophe. [353]\n\n### Sean Noble and CPPR focused on the House to oppose the ACA while Karl Rove used **American Crossroads and its 501(c)(4), Crossroads GPS**, to work on the Senate. [306] Ed Gillespie continued to focus on governorships and state legislatures, in accordance with his REDMAP strategy. [306] \n\n### The operatives steered their funds to obscure, smaller groups to meet the legal requirement that no single public welfare group could spend more than half of its funds on elections. [306] Soon, to the unschooled eye, a rash of spontaneous attacks on Democrats appeared to be breaking out all across the country. [306] In reality, the effort was so centrally coordinated, as one participant put it, “there wasn’t one race in which there were multiple groups airing ads at the same time”. [306]\n\n&gt; Noble explained his methodology later to Eliana Johnson, Washington editor for the conservative publication National Review, with an Excel spreadsheet showing a list of Democratic congressmen “in order of their likelihood of defeat” which would grow to 105 by August. Then, he assigned each congressional district with a “win potential” of 1-5 and each candidate with a score of 1-40 “based on the voting record of each member and the composition of the district, among other things”, then sorting the 105 targeted candidates into “three tiers, based on the likelihood of a GOP victory” and disbursing the Koch network’s money accordingly. [307]\n\nFor example, as explained to National Review, Noble chose the **60 Plus Association**, a right-wing version of the senior citizens’ lobby AARP to air attack ads on Democrats in “Arizona’s 1st Congressional District, Florida’s 2nd and 24th, Indiana’s 2nd, Minnesota’s 8th, New York’s 20th, Ohio’s 16th, Pennsylvania’s 3rd, and Wisconsin’s 3rd and 8th Congressional Districts”. [307]\n\nHe used **Americans for Job Security** to air ads in “New York’s 24th, North Carolina’s 2nd and 8th, Ohio’s 18th, and Virginia’s 9th Congressional District” [307] Despite being founded in 1997 by a million-dollar donation from the insurance industry, its physical office in Alexandria, VA was almost empty with only one employee, a 25 year old Republican campaign aide acquainted with Noble. [308] It was accused of being “a sham front group” by Public Citizen, a liberal group favoring tighter campaign finance regulations, and when charged with violations of fair election rules by Alaskan state officials, it settled for $20,000 with no admission of guilt [308] It was given $4.8 million in 2010 by Noble’s CPPR. [308]\n\nHe used Iowa-based **American Future Fund**, a 501(c)(4) “social welfare” group, to air attack ads in Alabama’s 2nd, Colorado’s 7th, New Mexico’s 1st, and Washington’s 2nd Congressional Districts. [307] Though AFF was founded in 2008 by an Iowa Republican operative, Bruce Rastetter, one of the country’s largest ethanol producers, its tax records showed that 87% of its funds in 2009 and about 50% in 2010 came from Noble’s CPPR. [308]\n\nRick Boucher, a conservative Democratic congressman representing the rural Virginia district encompassing Saltville, the Olin Corporation’s factory town that turned into a toxic waste dump, lost his seat to his Republican opponent, Morgan Griffith, after AFP and other conservative outside groups spent $2 million on attack ads against him. [309-310] He was a Virginia lawyer and strong ally of business interests who had been crucial to the passage of the cap-and-trade bill in the House, drafting much of the measure and then winning support for it from huge energy firms like Duke Energy and had represented the district for 28 years in the House and 8 more before that in the state senate. [309] He had given away so many goodies to the coal industry while negotiating the bill that many environmentalists were disgusted but the fact that he supported the bill angered conservative extremists such as the Virginia coal barons funding the Koch network. [309] He was exactly the kind of centrist that big, polarized political money was rendering extinct. [309]\n\n&gt; Boucher said, “This is Appalachia! It’s a cheap media market. That would have been like $10 million most other places. [His opponent] actually didn’t raise and spend much, but he didn’t have to, because the Koch groups carried his water”. [310]\n\n### When House Democrats passed a bill (2010?), backed by President Obama, to eliminate the carried interest loophole (which allowed much of the income of hedge fund and private equity managers to be categorized as “interest” at less than half the income rate then applied to long-term gains), Stephen Schwarzman (estimated worth of $6.5 billion [year? 312]) and others were enraged. [311-313] Former Obama bundler Ken Griffin, founder and CEO of the Chicago-based hedge fund Citadel, turned Republican in what came known as the “Hedge Fund Switch”. These billionaires attended the Koch’s second summit of the year in Aspen (where of the 200 or so participants, with least 11 were on Forbes’ list of the 400 wealthiest Americans, had an estimated wealth of $129.1 billion) and pumped at least $10 million into groups boosting Republicans in the midterms, often without any public trace. [314]\n\n### The Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank, estimated that this loophole cost the government over $6 billion a year - the cost of providing healthcare to 3 million children. [313] Of that total, $2 billion a year from the tax break went to just 25 individuals. [313]\n\nEven before the Republicans formally took control of the House, the president felt forced into making concessions on tax issues vital to the donor class. [354] \n\nIn December 2010, he reached a deal that temporarily extended unemployment benefits for millions out of work and reducing payroll taxes and other help for the middle class in exchange for extending Bush-era income tax cuts benefitting the wealthy that had been set to expire. [354] \n\nThose cuts lowered the top income tax rate from 39.6% to 35%, and unearned income taxes mostly earned by the rich, for example, capital gains taxes from 20% to 15% and dividend taxes from 39.6% to 15%. As a result, many rich Americans were taxed at a lower rate than middle and working class earners. [354] Republican negotiators insisted on cuts on estate taxes costing the Treasury $23 billion and saving 6600 of the wealthiest taxpayers $1.5 million each. [357] \n\nThe Kochs, DeVoses and 15 other of the richest families in the country including the Waltons of Walmart and the Mars candy clan, according to one 2006 report, had spent almost half a billion on lobbying for the “death tax” cuts since 1998, because the 17 families stood to save $71 billion. [357] Only .27% of all estates were wealthy enough to be affected by estate taxes. [357]\n\nIn the beginning, the 16th Amendment which legalized the income tax was only levied on the very rich. [355] Rates were especially high in wartime when taxes were seen as the patriotic duty of the privileged, such as 77% for top earners in WWI, and 94% in WWII (which the Scaife family avoided with its trusts and foundations). [355]\n\nA 2008 study of the wealthiest 400 taxpayers showed they earned an average of $202 million and paid an effective tax rate of less than 20%. [354] 60% of their declared income derived from capital gains. [354]\n\nThe Kochs’ AFP pledged to spend $45 million for the 2010 midterms, Karl Rove’s American Crossroads $52 million, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce $75 million. [316-317] \n\nFor the 2012 presidential campaign, the Kochs came up with a new nonprofit corporation, a 501(c)(6) business league, the **Association for American Innovation (AAI)** to collect donations, categorized as “membership dues” partially tax deductible as business expenses. [375] Donors could be both anonymous and outside the charitable scrutiny of the state attorneys general, further safeguarding secrecy. [375] During 2011 alone, tax records show that AAI had over $250 million, over a quarter of a billion. [375] \n\nAAI soon changed its name to **Freedom Partners**, funding the same political front groups that the Kochs used in the 2010 midterms, such as $115 million to Sean Noble’s Center to Protect Patient Rights (CPPR) and $32.3 million to David Koch’s Americans for Prosperity (AFP) from November 2011 to October 2012. [375] \n\n### Later, an initial 2015 plan to spend $889 million to purchase the presidency [xvi] was downgraded to $750 million, several hundred million to races beneath the presidential level [xvi]\n\nFoster Friess, the Wyoming mutual fund magnate, committed $3 million to found The Daily Caller in 2010, which Charles Koch’s foundation would later back as well, after a single luncheon conversation with Tucker Carlson, its prospective editor in chief, to be a conservative version of The Huffington Post. [320] In fact, it functioned more as an outlet for opposition research paid for by donors. (After The New Yorker published Jane Meyer’s investigative article on the Kochs, “Covert Operations”, The Daily Caller was the chosen receptacle for the retaliatory opposition research on her, but when leads proved false, they decided not to run it. [320]\n\n&gt; Bob Phillips, head of the North Carolina chapter of Common Cause, an organization for stricter controls on political money, concluded that the Citizens United decision was an even bigger “game changer” at the local level than at the national. [323] “Citizens United opened up the door. Now a candidate can literally be outspent by independent groups. We saw it in North Carolina, and a lot of the money was traced back to Art Pope”. [323] Chris Heagarty, a Democratic lawyer who ran for a legislative seat that fall in Raleigh, said, “If you put all of the Pope groups together, they and the North Carolina GOP spent more to defeat me than the guy who actually won. For an individual to have so much power is frightening. The government of North Carolina is for sale.” [323-324]\n\nPope countered that his political spending was not bribery, which was “illegal, corrupt, and something I’ve fought hard against in North Carolina” but “education” of citizens. [324] Of the 22 local legislative races targeted by Pope, his family and their organizations in North Carolina in 2010, the Republicans won 18 in the historically Democratic state. [324-325] As he and Gillespie hoped, this placed both chambers of the general assembly firmly under Republican majorities for the first time since 1870. [325] According to the Institute for Southern Studies, 3/4 of the spending by independent groups in North Carolina’s 2010 state races came from accounts linked to Pope. [325] The total amount that Pope and his family and groups backed by him spent - $2.2 million - was not much by national standards but enough to exert crucial influence within one state, which would repeat across the nation. [325] \n\n&gt; The chairman of REDMAP, former Republican congressman, Tom Reynolds, later told Politico, “The Obama team has done some amazing things, those guys are really something, but the Democrats plain got skunked on the state houses”. [326]\n\nIt’s likely given historical trends and an unemployment rate topping 9.5% that a Republican wave in 2010 was inevitable, but Noble had made so much progress that, by the final weeks in the campaign, he was aiming beyond his 3rd tier candidates at congressmen no one had ever believed were vulnerable. [327]\n\n### On November 2, 2010, the Democrats suffered massive defeats, losing control of the House of Representatives. [327] Republicans gained 63 seats in the House - the largest such turnover since 1948 - and half a dozen seats in the Senate [327], making North Carolina, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin newly Republican states. [328] At the state level, the Democratic losses were even more staggering, with Republicans gaining 675 seats. [327-328]\n\n### The Ohio Republican, John Boehner, the new Speaker of the House, now had a caucus bursting with Tea Party enthusiasts who had ridden to power by attacking government in general and Obama in particular, several winning primaries against moderates. [327] Compromise wasn’t in their interest [327] \n\n&gt; Political scientist Lee Drutman, in a study for the nonpartisan Sunlight Foundation, found that increasingly concentrated wealth in America resulted in more polarization and extremism, especially on the right, the “radical rich”. [335] \n\n&gt; Very rich benefactors in the Republican Party were far more opposed to taxes and regulations than the rest of the country. [335] He said, “The more Republicans depend upon the 1% of the 1% of donors, the more conservative they tend to be”. [335]\n\n### Harvard’s Theda Skocpol found that the House “took the biggest leap to the far right” since political scientists began recording quantitative measurements of legislators’ positions, as exemplified by the House Energy and Commerce Committee. [335] \n\n### In the previous Congress, the Committee had been chaired by Henry Waxman, the liberal Democrat from California who had quarterbacked the House’s successful passage of the cap-and-trade bill that was defeated in the Senate. [336] Now, the committee was packed with Republicans owing huge campaign debts to the Kochs. [336] Koch Industries had donated to 22 of the committee’s 31 Republican members and 5 of its Democratic members. [336] Koch Industries PAC was the single largest oil and gas industry donor to members of the panel, outspending even ExxonMobil. [336]\n\nCongressman Morgan Griffith, victor over Rick Boucher in the district representing Saltville, Virginia, became a lead player in the House Republicans’ “war on the EPA” [336-337] and within a month after taking office, he and other House Republicans gutted the EPA’s budget by a punishing 27%, which was later modified to 16% with the Senate. [337] By then, the 1980 Superfund law charging polluters like the Olin Corporation for cleanup costs expired and the $3.8 billion accumulated in the fund had run out, leaving taxpayers rather than corporations to clean up the mess. [337]\n\nThe Republicans tried to halt action on global warming, prevent the protection of any new endangered species, permit uranium mining adjacent to the Grand Canyon, deregulate mountaintop mining, prevent coal ash from being designated a form of air pollution, and proposed legislation requiring it to consider the costs of its regulations, without regard to the scientific and health benefits, which the editorial page of the Los Angeles Times said “rips the heart out of the 40-year-old Clean Air Act”. [340]\n\n### Two months into their tenure, the House Energy and Commerce Committee Republicans led a crusade against alternative, renewable energy programs. [340-341] They successfully branded the government’s stimulus support for Solyndra, a California manufacturer of solar panels, and other clean energy firms as an Obama scandal, while some of Solyndra’s biggest backers were members of the conservative Walton family, the founders of Walmart. [341]\n\n## By the end of 2011, only 20 of the 65 Republicans who responded to a survey were willing to say that they believed climate change was causing the planet to warm. [341] \n\nIn 2009, Michigan congressman Fred Upton had said, “Climate change is a serious problem that necessitates serious solutions. I strongly believe that everything must be on the table as we seek to reduce carbon emissions”. [339] But in 2010, Upton, like many Republican moderates, faced a potentially career-killing primary challenge from the right. [339] He reversed his position by co-authoring an op-ed piece in The Wall Street Journal with Tim Phillips, AFP’s president, where they called the EPA’s plans to regulation carbon emissions “an unconstitutional power grab that will kill millions of jobs unless Congress steps in”, and he secured the chairmanship of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. [339-340] Robert Inglis of South Carolina, who accepted the growing scientific consensus on climate change, was defeated for violating “Republican orthodoxy”. [339] \n\n&gt; Tim Phillips, AFP’s president, said “We’ve made great headway. What it means for candidates on the Republican side is, if you … buy into green energy or you play footsie on this issue, you do so at your political peril”. [342]\n\n## By 2011, Speaker Boehner, among the most powerful elected officials in the country, third in line in the order of presidential succession, traveled to New York to personally beseech David Koch for help with a Congressional stalemate regarding the debt ceiling.

        "selftext": "When I first started at my present company, the IT infrastructure was outdated like very outdated. I started working here towards the end of 2020 and all of the network switches were 10/100. The ERP system was a terminal based system, and we were still printing using dot matrix printers.\n\nSince then we have migrated to a cloud based ERP, and I have replaced our switches to gigabit switches. At the time we were using WatchGuard XTM 330 as our main device, and WatchGuard XTM 33 devices at two branch offices. These were pretty much end of life when I started, so we moved over to a new VOIP provider who provided us with Cato boxes at each site. \n\nWithin the past year our VOIP/Cato invoices went from around $1.5k per month to $2.6k for no apparent reason. We'll be terminating our contracts with the vendor, and looks like it will be worth while switching back to WatchGuard devices. I still have our old boxes so I should be able to make use of the trade up deals.\n\nI was wondering if anybody could review the devices I am thinking of upgrading to. \n\nNetwork Devices at HQ: 65 (Computers, VOIP phones, Printers, and Tablets) = T290\n\nNetwork Devices at Branch1: 25 (Computers, VOIP phones, Printers, and Tablets) = T85\n\nNetwork Devices at Branch 2: 5 (1 x Computer, 3 x VOIP phones, and 1 x Tablet) = T45\n\nVPN Users: 1 Full time, 10 on / off users.\n\nWe have Verizon Fios at all 3 locations, 2 with gigabit speeds, and the other around 500mbps. \n\nAt the HQ location I was looking at putting a T290, 1 x T85 @ Branch 1, 1 x T45 @ Branch 2.\n\nHope this is allowed here.",

        "title": "Recap of the AMA of May 30th with Michael MO",
        "selftext": "  \nHello everyone!\n\nI wanted to share an exciting update with you all. Today, we had an AMA (Ask Me Anything) session with Michael Mo, the CEO of KULR Technology. The AMA took place in our subreddit chat, and it was a great opportunity for us to interact directly with Michael and get our questions answered.\n\n**Transcript of KULR Technology AMA (Ask Me Anything) Session**\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:01 PM - Good Afternoon Everyone! Thank you for being here for the KULR Technology AMA. We're getting Michael into the KULR account right now and we'll get started. We received over 40 questions over the past 24 hours. We're going to run through all of the ones we can starting with those previously received. New questions will be recorded and added to the end.\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:05 PM - Hello everyone, thanks for joining today.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:05 PM - Going to tag the user who asked the question too.\n\nu/Crazerz**:** Which business segment do you expect to drive the most growth in the upcoming year? What initiatives are in place to maximize opportunities within this segment?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:06 PM - I see our KULR ONE Design Service driving most of the growth in the next 12 months, including the FTRC testing service and design services. That's a very sticky and fast-growing business for us and driving recurring revenue.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:07 PM - u/Crazerz: Does the company believe its competitive advantage is strengthening? If so, what key factors contribute to this?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:08 PM - Definitely strengthening in our competitive advantages. All from Data, Safety, and Speed. We provide our customers with battery cell data that they can't get anywhere else. And our safety focus heritage is getting more focus from customers, similar to how the chip industry prioritizes energy efficiency.\n\nu/CatosWizard**:** Hello Michael, I wanted to know about commercial partners and how you plan to expand that sector with your amazing products.\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:11 PM - I believe we will see a shift in batteries to safety-focused and thermal performance-focused solutions, and that's where KULR shines.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:11 PM - u/Crazerz: How is the company ensuring timely order deliveries amidst increased volumes to prevent backlog issues affecting revenue recognition?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:12 PM - With respect to revenue recognition, we follow established accounting rules. Meeting customer timing requests is critical. We are always trying to gain additional efficiencies to do more with the resources we have.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:13 PM - u/Crazerz: What are the critical milestones for achieving positive cash flow and profitability? How will the company navigate toward these goals?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:14 PM - Growing the revenue and controlling costs. It's simple and hard. We have been growing our revenue on both design services and product sales in Q1.\n\n**cwaim:** Hello Mr. Mo, hope you are having a great day. I wanted to ask if there are currently other products planned to be added to the KULR marketplace in the future (this may have been asked).\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:15 PM - We reduced our cash use and operating expenses by 23% and 25%. We will continue to look for efficiencies.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:15 PM - u/Crazerz: Are we still on track to achieve cash flow positivity by the end of Q2 2024?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:16 PM - We haven't provided official financial guidance at this time.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:17 PM - u/Crazerz: Many investors are curious which EV companies KULR is collaborating with. Can you elaborate on the secrecy of these names?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:18 PM - We are under NDA, so we can't disclose the names of our big customers. We do our PR to keep our investors informed on the progress and also as a way to market our products to more customers. It's very cost-effective for us.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:18 PM - u/Crazerz: Is the previously stated guidance of $26 to $34 million for 2024, as mentioned in an earlier interview with CFO Shaw Canter, still accurate?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:19 PM - We are not giving 2024 financial guidance at this time.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:19 PM - u/Crazerz: Any plans for future share offerings or sales, especially regarding the recent debt cancellation with Yorkville? How does this impact the company's financial strategy?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:21 PM - We have a policy of not commenting on future financial activities. KULR is in the strongest financial position and balance sheet in over a year to execute our growth plan. And we will do everything we can to build shareholder value.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:23 PM - u/Slimjimpapicholo: Can anyone ask Michael Mo about what he thinks about the stock price being an unfair representation of KULR? I think a lot of investors are blindsided by the company's strength and portfolio due to the current share price.\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:24 PM - I think the macro market environment is still quite challenging for smaller companies like KULR to get investor awareness and appreciation.\n\nu/jake_zzzz**:** KULR has consistently stated that there would be no more offerings/dilution after the Yorkville debt was retired, but that seems difficult with the current cash situation. Can you elaborate on how KULR plans to protect shareholders without offering more shares?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:25 PM - We will continue to execute the business and grow and get to profitability. Then you will get more larger investor base appreciation. It took NVDA 30 years to get to today's AI boom. I won't take us 30 years to get the market to appreciate what we do. We have been at it for 10 years.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:26 PM - Reminder to the chat. We're answering questions from yesterday's post. We'll answer new questions at the end here.\n\nu/KingNebar**:** Any plans to manufacture and sell testing equipment to other companies?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:29 PM - No plan to sell equipment. However, because our testing service is booked for a couple of quarters out, we are expanding the testing equipment line and talking to customers about subscription services models, preferred allocation services, and other recurring revenue services to increase utilization and profitability, and make our customers more successful.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:30 PM - u/Ill-Desk-1979: How do you plan on stopping the stock from a reverse split?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:31 PM - We announced that NYSE has informed us that we have gained compliance on the share price requirement. So we are in no obligation to do a reverse split and will continue to do all we can to build shareholder value.\n\nu/ethereal3xp**:** Hi Michael. Thank you for doing this. Are any of KULR's products currently in the production stage/orders? If this is the case at this time or not, is there capability for this type of scale of production?\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:32 PM - u/Crazerz: What's the company's future patent application strategy? Any specific areas or technologies targeted for patent protection?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:33 PM - Our patent strategy has been consistent to patent the core technology and its applications. For example, our TRS technology, we patented how to build it and how to use it in a system. As we build out different pieces of KULR ONE Platform, we will continue to patent materials, configurations, and applications.\n\nu/BidAcceptable7555**:** With different Battery Technologies being developed, does KULR testing apply only to Lithium Ion? I know Natron is manufacturing Sodium Ion batteries. Would KULR tech still apply to that one?\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:35 PM - u/Crazerz: Regarding the online store, any plans to expand its availability internationally?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:36 PM - We just launched the online store, so we are focused on the US market and serving fire departments, Hazmat groups, etc. It's been a busy time. We will expand to international markets later.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:36 PM - Michael, above you said \"in obligation.\" Can you confirm that was a typo based on the recent PR?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:37 PM - Sorry, yes, a typo. We are in NO obligation to do a reverse split.\n\nu/Dense-Corgi2642**:** Any talk of potential government mandates on safe case-type products on EVs?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:39 PM - Government regulations and mandates take a long time. Time and uncertainty are the enemies of business and making money. So we take matters into our own hands and work with OEMs directly to use SafeCase in their production and recycling applications.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:40 PM - u/New-Razzmatazz-2253: What are some obstacles or hardships you believe the company may encounter in the future if any, regarding licensing and regulations?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:41 PM - Regulations have actually been good to KULR. The requirements for battery safety from DOT, NASA, UPS, etc., are beneficial to our business.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:42 PM - u/Sleepytouch: Can you comment on the DoE grant process? Can KULR apply for funding from the DoE? What about partnering with one of the recipients?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:43 PM - The application for DoE grant is very competitive. It's always good for a company to apply. We believe partnering with companies who have received grants would yield good results as well.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:44 PM - u/Ill-Desk-1979: Can KULR try to get Starlink on its side for internet access?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:45 PM - We do use Starlink for our offices. Does that count?\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:45 PM - u/Texasaggie12345: Do you plan on setting up any type of system for tracking/trading carbon credits?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:46 PM - No plans at this time.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:46 PM - u/texasaggie12345: Do you have any plans for significant asset purchases in the next year?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:47 PM - No plans at this time.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:48 PM - u/Loud_Ad2372: Will KULR ever use their SafeCases for residential batteries similar to the Tesla Powerwall? Will there be battery management software applications added to KULR's products?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:49 PM - SafeCase is versatile and can be used in different applications, including residential energy storage applications.\n\nu/skeff88**:** Can you speak to how exactly the rollout with Amazon is going? And what kind of deal you have going with them?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:50 PM - Amazon is the marketplace. We use their network for order fulfillment and delivery. Their fees are not cheap, but it's very effective for us.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:52 PM - u/QueenandHero: What is the most significant milestone KULR has achieved in recent years, and how does the company plan to build on this success to maintain a competitive edge in the market?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:53 PM - Our TRS technology going to Mars and testing and licensing FTRC with FAA are significant milestones. We plan to extend both products to other applications and build out our KULR ONE Platform.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:54 PM - u/KingNebar: Has KULR considered expanding into adjacent markets, such as electric vehicle charging infrastructure, to further diversify its product offerings?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:56 PM - We would consider all options in the EV value chain. We do what our customers and partners need us to do to help them succeed.\n\nu/Manny2150**:** Any large testing orders in the past year?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:57 PM - Yes, there are a number of multi-quarter testing orders in the past year.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:58 PM - u/ll-Desk-1979: Is there any new news from today that you would like to share with us?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:59 PM - Not today. But, stay tuned.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 7:00 PM - Going to call this one for now. Thank you for taking the time Michael and thanks to everyone who asked a question. Have a great night everyone.\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 7:00 PM - Thanks everyone! Great questions. Have a great evening.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 7:00 PM - Going to close the chat so people can see the messages here.

If you believe in the company (I do - their tech is market leading and have patents to protect it) and think that battery safety and efficiency is going to be important in 5+ years then best to just buy when cheap and ignore it rather than following it day by day.

        "selftext": "\nNo, not even if you do it in a county that borders Mexico.\n\nJOE LANCASTER | 3.14.2025\n\nOne of President Donald Trump's Day 1 executive orders designated \"certain international cartels\" as \"foreign terrorist organizations,\" a classification that according to the State Department \"play[s] a critical role in our fight against terrorism and [is] an effective means of curtailing support for terrorist activities and pressuring groups to get out of the terrorism business.\"\n\nTo that end, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) announced a new rule cracking down on cash transactions this week, but only in certain geographical regions. No matter the administration's intent to target cartels, the rule will expand government surveillance of its citizens.\n\n\nFinCEN \"issued a Geographic Targeting Order (GTO) to further combat the illicit activities and money laundering of Mexico-based cartels and other criminal actors along the southwest border of the United States,\" according to the announcement. \"The GTO requires all money services businesses (MSBs) located in 30 ZIP codes across California and Texas near the southwest border to file Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs) with FinCEN at a $200 threshold, in connection with cash transactions.\"\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the change \"underscores our deep concern with the significant risk to the U.S. financial system of the cartels, drug traffickers, and other criminal actors along the Southwest border.\"\n\nThe order lists all 30 ZIP codes in counties that each abut the U.S.–Mexico border: San Diego and Imperial Counties in California; and Cameron, El Paso, Hidalgo, Maverick, and Webb Counties in Texas. California's are the state's only two border counties, but the five in Texas encompass only a small portion of the state's total southern border. It's not clear why these seven counties were chosen out of the 44 total border counties, including any in Arizona or New Mexico.\n\n\nFederal law requires banks, as well as businesses that provide services like check cashing or currency exchange, to fill out CTRs as a means of protecting against illegal activity like money laundering. Financial transactions totaling at least $10,000 in cash per day—including deposits, withdrawals, or a combination—require a CTR, where the institution must collect and record personal identifying information from the client, like a Social Security or tax ID number. The reports are then sent to FinCEN. (CTRs are different from suspicious activity reports, which are only triggered when a financial institution actively suspects the customer might be doing something illegal.)\n\nThe rule remains in effect in the rest of the country, but in those seven border counties, FinCEN has dropped the reporting threshold from $10,000 to $200. While ATM transactions don't often qualify since they typically have a much lower withdrawal limit, they are technically also subject to the CTR threshold—meaning a $200 cash withdrawal in one of seven counties could soon make one subject to a federal financial report.\n\n\"More than one million Americans are about to face a new level of financial surveillance,\" writes Nicholas Anthony, a policy analyst at the Cato Institute. \"Financial surveillance in the United States has long needed reform, but this move is in the wrong direction.\"\n\n\nAnthony says rather than lowering the threshold, the $10,000 baseline is overdue to be raised.\n\nThe federal government first began requiring banks to log and report all cash transactions of $10,000 or more in 1952. The Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 established CTRs as we know them today, and Treasury regulations enacted in 1972 set the threshold at $10,000.\n\nAs Anthony points out, the $10,000 threshold has remained since that time. If it had been raised even just to keep up with inflation, the current minimum for filing a CTR would be anywhere between $80,000 and $180,000, depending on whether you start from the pre-CTR rules in 1952 or the adoption of the current rules two decades later.\n\nInstead, the CTR minimum has remained the same since it was first enacted, even as the power of the dollar has declined: $10,000 today is equivalent to $1,372 in 1972—a fraction of what the regulation required.\n\nFor this reason, the number of CTRs has ballooned far past the point that any bureaucracy could feasibly find it useful. Last year, FinCEN reported that for FY 2023, businesses and financial institutions filed around 20.8 million CTRs—an average of 57,000 per day.\n\n\n\"Inflation may have contributed to the increase in volume of CTRs filed, which has increased by about 62 percent since fiscal year 2002,\" according to a December 2024 report from the Government Accountability Office. \"The inflation-adjusted threshold in 2023 would have been about $72,880. Using an inflation-adjusted threshold would have reduced the number of CTRs filed by at least 90 percent annually since 2014.\"\n\nThe Trump administration's push to crack down on penny-ante cash transactions is reminiscent of actions the Biden administration attempted.\n\nIn a 2021 bill ostensibly passed to provide relief from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Biden administration included a provision that would require gig economy companies like Uber, eBay, and Etsy to report anyone to the IRS who earned at least $600 per year on their platform—a dramatic cut from the previous minimum of $20,000 per year or 200 transactions.\n\nThe Biden administration also proposed a rule requiring banks to report to the IRS any customers with at least $600 in annual deposits and withdrawals—in other words, nearly everybody. (The IRS has since delayed the gig worker rule, and the Biden administration raised the reporting requirement on the latter from $600 to $10,000 annually.)\n\n\nClearly, the Trump administration is adamant that drug cartels south of the border should be brought to heel—hence the repeated calls by Republicans over the past few years for the U.S. to invade or bomb Mexico. But just as those methods would be an aggressive overreach of U.S. foreign policy, subjecting innumerable law-abiding citizens to additional financial surveillance is an aggressive overreach of fiscal policy.",

Yes, I know you get what you pay for.\n\nWe have used Todyl, and while we like the product, there are just enough issues that we need to reconsider.  Todyl's support, at least for us, has really not met our needs.  Also, the SASE client can take a very long time to connect as well as the issues using it on while on a plane, some hotel WiFi's, and other public networks that have captive portals.\n\nWhen I search Reddit on Timus Networks there really is little information.  The few posts I've seen here are from users who either RARELY post, or they have only posted on SASE threads (and little at that).  While the company is now HQ'ed in the USA, I see that they were previously a company called Berqnet.  I think originally a Turkish company?\n\nI am really hoping that the real members here that have tried to partner with or are partners of Timus Networks would chime in.  How's the product?  Is it stable?  What kind of issues have you experienced?  How's the support and the company customer service in general?  Are they a full-proxy with SSL inspection, or just a DNS filter?  If full proxy, are you able to bypass the SSL inspection/proxy for those sites that are fussy about SSL inspection?\n\nThanks in advance\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "body": "We've been partnered with Timus going on about 10 months. \n\nTo answer the questions from your post:\n\nThe product is stable. I haven't had any reports of users not able to connect through their client to the Timus gateway and from what I've experienced if there is an issue with bandwidth it's on the user's ISP as the Timus gateway provides solid bandwidth.\n\nThe only issues that I've really experienced came from their client dates (pre version 4.0) that wouldn't always automatically update and would have to be kicked off manually and sometimes when the management portal gets updated, it messes with the partner-to-tenant permissions, and you have to select all of them again.\n\nAs far as support goes, as others have stated, a direct slack channel to support and pretty much an \"all hands-on deck\" feel when you reach out to them as they respond and remediate pretty quickly. I reached out about a month ago on a Saturday and had someone on video/screenshare within a few minutes looking into the issue.\n\nIts full SSL inspection with easy certificate deployment directly from their client. I haven't had to bypass any sites thus far so I can't comment on that.\n\nAnother thing that it has done for us is help secure the on-prem network as we no longer have to leave SSLVPN ports open on the firewall as we have a connector (that's free) to go back to the on-prem network over IPSec. \n\nIt also checks the box for MFA through M365/Workspace/Okta, etc. \n\nFor clients that are fully remote or don't have any real on-prem infrastructure like servers, we've shifted to just securing the network at the endpoint.\n\nI'd recommend getting a trial going and check it out to see what you like/don't like.",

A VPN client in some cases is free, but in his case, what is provided by Timus simplified the sale: In most cases the problem was with users remembering how to use other VPN Software, or struggling when they travelled.   This took care of it for them and long term has/will reduce future expenses and increase business revenue.  People working makes more money than people frustated and not working.\n\nSo, I presented an ROI discussion to my clients on how this was actually increasing their bottom line.\n\nThe optional performance tracking is a big sell for some of my clients without any additional costs in licensing.\n\nSo, this has been a win for us and our clients.",

            "body": "We have been in the same boat. We were pretty heavy Todyl adopters and for a number of reasons we pursued alternatives.  There are some similarities - it is agent-based, there are no physical devices required, set up can be done pretty much on demand, both leverage firewall rules and content filtering. \n\nTimus charges per gateway. Todyl doesn’t unless you want a static IP. In that case, Timus’s static IP is a little less expensive. However, Todyl functions without that. Timus’s WireGuard performance has a little more latency than Todyl’s autobahn network. However, it isn’t noticeable and even for our most noisy SASE client, Timus’s latency hasn’t posed a problem. \n\nWhere Timus differentiated itself is in a few areas. First, per user pricing instead of per device pricing. Second, IPSec tunnels do not carry an extra charge so we don’t have to place agents on servers in order for users to connect to them remotely. Timus has built in security functionality that can be leveraged as IoCs.  Timus also offers us NFRs.  Finally, we have not had nearly as many small issues on Timus as we have had on Todyl. \n\nThis brings me to the biggest differentiator. Todyl’s support really is lacking. You have to submit a ticket and then we found we would have to wait many minutes and repeat troubleshooting tasks to convince them of an issue and we rarely get offered to do a screen share. Timus uses a Slack channel and we get immediate solution oriented support. \n\nWith all of this said, we still like Todyl and use them for some workflow. However, new clients that require SASE will be set up with Timus and SASE clients that have complaints or issues will be transitioned.\n\nHope this helps!",

She was able to complete her laptop and phone setup without any assistance from anyone. She absolutely loves using Timus instead of VPN with duo.\n\nOur cost along with the per use model instead of having to pay for licenses upfront under a 1 2 or 3 year deal makes it an easy product to make a decent margin on while keeping our clients secure!",

        "selftext": "This report provides a detailed analysis of the tools, actors, and financial networks enabling state and non-state entities to manipulate social media virality and suppress content. It highlights the convergence of marketing and propaganda, with a focus on foreign interference (e.g., Russia, China, Iran) and compromised domestic actors within the U.S. Specific case studies, named entities, and financial pathways are included to illustrate the scale and sophistication of these operations.\n\n---\n\n### **1\\. Mechanisms of Social Media Manipulation**\n\n**a. Algorithmic Exploitation**\n\n- **Platform-Specific Vulnerabilities**:\n\n- **Facebook/Meta**: Exploitation of EdgeRank (content prioritization based on engagement) to amplify divisive content. The 2016 Cambridge Analytica scandal leveraged user data to microtarget voters.\n- **YouTube**: Manipulation of recommendation algorithms to promote extremist content (e.g., 2019 \"Alternative Influence Network\" study).\n- **Twitter/X**: Use of trending topic algorithms to amplify bot-driven hashtags (e.g., Russian troll farm \"Internet Research Agency\" (IRA) campaigns).\n- **Deboosting Tools**:\n\n- Google’s **Jigsaw Unit** developed \"Redirect Method\" to demote extremist content. Critics argue such tools can be co-opted to suppress legitimate dissent.\n\n**b. Microtargeting &amp; Data Harvesting**\n\n- **Key Actors**:\n\n- **ADA AI:** Partnered with DNC for Obama and Hillary campaigns, using large data scrapes and mass privacy invasion to engage in mass persuasion techniques to sway voting.\n- **Cambridge Analytica** (defunct): Partnered with SCL Group to harvest 87 million Facebook profiles, targeting U.S. voters in 2016.\n- **Palantir Technologies**: Provided data analytics to government agencies, raising concerns about dual-use risks for surveillance and propaganda.\n- **Clearview AI**: Facial recognition data sold to entities like the UAE, potentially enabling personalized disinformation.\n- **Marketing Firms as Propaganda Channels**:\n\n- Russian state media **RT (Russia Today)** and **Sputnik** laundered narratives through U.S. marketing firms.\n- China’s **China Daily** and **Xinhua** collaborate with Western PR firms (e.g., **Huntsworth PLC**) to amplify CCP-aligned content.\n\n**c. Strategic Partnerships &amp; Financial Flows**\n\n- **Front Organizations**:\n\n- **Tenet Media** (U.S. front for Russia’s **Social Design Agency**): Funneled $10M to influencers targeting minorities and swing states (WIRED, 2023).\n- **IRA** (Internet Research Agency): Funded by oligarch **Yevgeny Prigozhin**, indicted by the Mueller investigation for 2016 election interference.\n- **Financial Obfuscation**:\n\n- Cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin) used by **North Korea’s Lazarus Group** to fund disinformation campaigns.\n- Shell companies in Cyprus (**Mossack Fonseca**) and Seychelles channel funds to U.S. influencers.\n\n---\n\n### **2\\. Case Studies of Foreign Influence**\n\n**a. Russian Interference**\n\n- **Project Lakhta**: IRA operatives posed as Black Lives Matter activists, amplifying racial tensions via fake accounts (Mueller Report, 2019).\n- **Nexus of Tech and Politics**: **Andrii Derkach** (Ukrainian MP) laundered Kremlin narratives through Rudy Giuliani, influencing 2020 election discourse.\n\n**b. Chinese Influence Operations**\n\n- **United Front Work Department (UFWD)**: Infiltrated diaspora communities via platforms like **WeChat**, censoring criticism of the CCP.\n- **TikTok/ByteDance**: Algorithmic promotion of pro-CCP content (e.g., downplaying Uyghur persecution) while suppressing dissident voices.\n\n**c. Iranian Cyber Influence**\n\n- **Endless Mayfly**: Fake news sites and AI-generated personas targeted U.S. voters in 2020, impersonating Proud Boys and ANTIFA (FireEye, 2020).\n\n### **3\\. Domestic Actors &amp; Content Moderation (Expanded)**\n\n**a. Government-Pressure Dynamics**\n\n- **Agencies Involved**:\n\n- **DHS’s CISA**: Flagged “misinformation” to platforms during COVID-19, drawing criticism from both conservatives (e.g., vaccine skepticism) and progressives (e.g., lab-leak theory suppression).\n- **FBI FITF**: Pushed platforms to suppress stories like the Hunter Biden laptop (alleged Russian disinformation) and, in other cases, anti-BLM narratives.\n\n**b. Domestic Political Manipulation**\n\n- **Conservative-Aligned Groups**:\n\n- **Turning Point USA**: Amplified election fraud claims via meme campaigns.\n- **Project Veritas**: Used covert recordings to discredit media outlets, later amplified by right-wing influencers.\n- **Progressive/Liberal-Aligned Groups**:\n\n- **PACRONYM** (nonprofit): Partnered with **Acronym** (now **FWIW**) to fund **Shadow Inc.**, a tech firm criticized for app failures during the 2020 Iowa caucuses. PACRONYM’s subsidiary **Crooked Media** (Pod Save America) leverages influencer networks to drive voter turnout.\n- **ADA (American Democracy Alliance)**: Progressive dark-money network funding AI-driven microtargeting tools to counter conservative messaging.\n- **Open Society Foundations (OSF)**: Funded research into “hate speech” detection algorithms, which critics argue have been weaponized to silence legitimate political discourse (e.g., labeling gender-critical views as “harmful”).\n- **Bipartisan/Libertarian Actors**:\n\n- **TikTok “News” Creators**: Both progressive and conservative influencers exploit TikTok’s algorithm to spread hyper-partisan content (e.g., pro-Palestine vs. pro-Israel narratives).\n- **FIRE (Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression)**: Criticizes both left- and right-leaning censorship on campuses and social media.\n\n---\n\n### **4\\. Financial Networks &amp; Enablers (Expanded)**\n\n- **Conservative Channels**:\n\n- **DonorsTrust** (dark-money conduit): Funded climate denialism and election-integrity narratives.\n- **The Heritage Foundation**: Lobbied for Section 230 reforms to pressure platforms on “anti-conservative bias.”\n- **Progressive Channels**:\n\n- **New Venture Fund**: Fiscal sponsor for progressive campaigns, including **Disinfo Defense League**, which pressured platforms to deboost “misinformation” tied to racial justice protests.\n- **Pierre Omidyar (eBay)**: Funded **First Draft News**, a now-defunct initiative partnering with platforms to flag “disinformation,” accused of partisan bias.\n- **Cross-Ideological Tech Enablers**:\n\n- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: Hosts Parler (conservative) and **Truthout** (progressive), facing criticism for arbitrary deplatforming.\n- **Neutral “Free Speech” Platforms**: **Rumble** (conservative) and **Bluesky** (progressive) replicate partisan echo chambers despite claims of neutrality.\n\n---\n\n### **5\\. Case Studies of Domestic Influence (Expanded)**\n\n**a. Conservative “Election Integrity” Campaigns**\n\n- **True the Vote**: Promoted debunked claims of 2020 voter fraud via viral documentaries (*2000 Mules*), amplified by **Breitbart** and **Fox News**.\n\n**b. Progressive “Disinformation” Mitigation Efforts**\n\n- **AI Forensics**: Groups like **AlgorithmWatch** and **ADA AI** (Algorithmic Defense Agency) audit platforms for “bias,” but face accusations of conflating conservative speech with harm.\n- **Cyber Civil Rights Initiative**: Lobbied for censorship of “non-consensual intimate imagery,” later expanded to include “misgendering” content.\n\n**c. Libertarian-Led Decentralization**\n\n- **Elon Musk’s Twitter/X**: Accused of boosting right-wing accounts (e.g., **Libs of TikTok**) while suppressing left-wing voices (e.g., **ElonJet tracker**).\n- **Meta’s Oversight Board**: Criticized by both sides for inconsistent rulings (e.g., allowing praise of Kyle Rittenhouse but banning some pro-Hamas content).\n\n---\n\n### **6\\. Recommendations (Revised for Neutrality)**\n\n- **Platform Accountability**:\n\n- **Transparency for All**: Require Meta, Google, and X to disclose *all* government/content moderation requests, whether from DHS, OSF-funded NGOs, or Heritage Foundation affiliates.\n- **Neutral Audits**: Third-party audits of algorithms by ideologically diverse groups (e.g., **FIRE**, **Brennan Center**, **Cato Institute**).\n- **Policy Reforms**:\n\n- Expand **Honest Ads Act** to cover *all* issue-based ads, including climate, racial justice, and election integrity.\n- Revise **FARA** to mandate disclosure by *any* foreign-tied group, including NGOs linked to OSF (Hungary’s criticism of Soros networks) or UAE-funded think tanks.\n- **Public Education**:\n\n- Teach media literacy frameworks that address biases across the spectrum (e.g., *AllSides*, *Ground News*).\n\n---\n\n### **Start Being Adults and Stop Falling for the Same Old Tricks**\n\nSocial media manipulation is not confined to one ideology or nation-state. Foreign actors exploit existing domestic polarization, while **both progressive and conservative entities** weaponize algorithms, data, and financial networks to control narratives. A holistic defense requires depoliticized transparency, equitable enforcement, and recognition that censorship demands from either flank risk eroding civil liberties.",

        "title": "Need help from ABCD community to fix Green Card Backlog",
        "selftext": "This topic was posted a couple times recently by others in brief but it ended up with bickering between ABCDs and FOBs. I am gonna try posting about it again because I think the previous posts were not detailed enough to address misconceptions. I truly believe if we can thoroughly understand each other, we can all be on the same page about the right thing to do. But bear in mind that this will be a long post because detail &amp; precision comes with verbosity.\n\n**Bottom Line On Top:** FOB Indians need support of the ABCD community to help raise voice against &amp; spread awareness about the repressive condition of Indians with an approved immigrant petition waiting for their green card in a backlog caused by discriminatory country-caps that has grown for over 15 years which has now become an exploitative tool for employers, affecting citizens too.\n\nThis post is more about asking for your vocal support &amp; stance towards fixing this discriminatory GC backlog rather than asking for any immediate action. If you are convinced, please do take action to push for reforms; the sooner the better.\n\n\\---\n\n**Situation and How it is Repressive:**\n\nHundreds of thousands of Indian immigrants who are in the US have an *approved* immigrant petition i.e. a petition for Permanent Residency aka a Green Card, but have a wait time of **literally several decades** to actually get the GC. In the mean time, they remain here legally on work-visas like H-1B or L1. Most are on H-1B and I don't really know much about L1 myself (yet) so I won't talk about it.\n\nThe H-1B visa is tied to the employer. That means:\n\n1. They cannot switch jobs easily. They can only work with employers that can file H1B.\n2. They cannot switch roles to outside their STEM field of study.\n3. They cannot be unemployed, else they lose the H1B visa and have to deport.\n   1. If they lose their job they have a grace period of just 60 days to find a new one.\n   2. They cannot take a break from work - eg. for childcare, focusing on a hobby, travel etc.\n4. They cannot hold a second job, and no secondary source of active income. Eg. Cannot drive for Uber, cannot actively make money from YouTube.\n5. Cannot start their own business. Cannot hire workers.\n6. Restrictions on getting promoted to different roles (eg. quality engineer to development engineer) because this resets their place in the green card queue (see next section).\n7. Cannot talk back to employers due to the risk of deportation from losing job. Eg. Can't protest against the boss for overworking, can't protest for underpay, can't press for deserving promotions, can't threaten to quit for exploitation.\n8. They are susceptible to a renewal of the H1b visa being denied for any arbitrary reason every 2-3 yrs at the Consulate window.\n\nThese restrictions may perhaps be understandable for the purpose of temporarily being on a work visa for a few years. However this is where the GC backlog comes in.\n\n**The Discriminatory Green Card Distribution system:**\n\nThe H-1B visa has a term of max 6 yrs, so people come with the understanding that they may have to leave after that, not demanding a green card. If the employer does sponsor a green card for them (through the Employment-Based channel), then once the petition is approved for the GC, H-1B can be renewed indefinitely with the logic being \"because they are already approved for a GC, they're just waiting for adjustment-of-status to Permanent Resident\". The AOS to PR (getting the actual GC) has a queue due to limited number of GCs available per year.  However, there is a country-cap (limit) of 7% of total Employment-Based GCs on each country. This effectively separates the GC queue into multiple queues **segregated based on country-of-birth**.\n\nOnce any country hits that limit, a backlog forms in that country's separate queue. This is where the discrimination comes into play - two persons, equally qualified, doing the same job, when sponsored an EB green card at the same time, have to wait different amount of times based solely on their country-of-birth which is an immutable factor, irrelevant in the EB petition for GC which is supposed to consider only skills of the candidate.\n\nThis violates equality of opportunity at an individual level. This provides reduced opportunity to an individual in a merit-based criterion, discriminating solely on the community that the individual belongs to (Indian origin). **This discrimination based on country-of-birth which is highly correlated with race is literally racism.**\n\n**The Backlog formed due to Segregation:**\n\nBecause more Indians meet the market demand of the current job market in the US than other people from other countries, for whatever reason - higher population or relevancy of skills to the job market -  the queue for Indians is fuller than that for other countries. This backlog has grown over the years as more &amp; more Indians met the job market demands in the US to an amount of roughly 500k primary applicants, and 1 million counting dependent spouses &amp; children. With these numbers, the wait time for anyone who got their petition filed roughly in 2014 onwards has a wait time of more than 10 yrs. My own wait time is 100+ years for a priority date of 2019; so effectively the US has banned me from getting a GC in my life because I was born in India.\n\n**The combination of H1B and GC Backlog:**\n\nNow combine the restrictions of H1B and decades-long wait time; what do you get? Employers have a stream of candidates who have a low negotiating power, low job mobility who can be here forever working for them, waiting for their green card with hopes of fixing the racist system. Thus, indentured-servitude.\n\nIn hiring candidates &amp; petitioning for their GC, employers are prohibited from discriminating based on nationality (rightly so, according to Civil Rights title VII), however the above situation is a clear incentive for employers to covertly prefer hiring GC-backlogged people (Indians) on H1B. Note that this is not to say that Indians who get hired are less qualified or cheap labor\\* - GC petition is a lengthy process that scrutinizes qualifications, skills &amp; relevancy to the job, checks that no American is displaced, and also requires the employer to pay the prevalent wage in that field in that area. Indian workers are also clearly doing their jobs well judging by the growth of the Tech industry filled with them. But given an equally qualified American or any other nationality immigrant, employers might jump hoops to prefer hiring an Indian on H1b (note: speculation, no source). **This now is discrimination against Americans and all other nationalities in being hired.**\n\n\\*\\[After initial offer at prevalent wage, because promotions &amp; subsequent negotiating power is curbed, wages may remain suppressed\\].\n\n**Reasons to support clearing the GC Backlog and Eliminating country-caps in EB category:**\n\n* Eliminate discrimination against Indians in obtaining a green card.\n* Eliminate potential discrimination against Americans &amp; other nationalities in hiring.\n* Provide humane working conditions and equal rights in employment to those currently stuck in this backlog for decades.\n* Prevent exploitation of immigrant workers by employers.\n* Make green card distribution equitable.\n* Promote investment, job creation, economic growth by freeing up backlogged employer-tied population.\n* Prevent aging out kids of Indian immigrants.\n\n**The Fight for Reforms:**\n\nAs you can see, the system is heavily stacked against Indian immigrants who have to be on a work visa with no voting rights. Because they're on a visa, they have limited power in influencing legislation. This is why we need your support, ABCDs! You are the Americans who are the closest representation for Indian immigrants by virtue of our shared heritage, some culture and ethnicity.\n\nI think the issues listed above are bad enough that any progressive person who supports equality, regardless of their background, would join the fight for the reforms. However, this issue has very limited visibility currently. That's a reason for spreading more awareness.\n\nAdditionally because of the perception of Indians being in well-paying jobs, there is a lack of interest in understanding what their real plight is. But that does not mean their plight is undeserving of sympathy or improvement. Also, not all Indians work in high paying Big Tech jobs or Medicine; there are hundreds of thousands of Indians who work in other STEM fields like other fields of engineering, healthcare, or even smaller tech jobs that pay close to the median income.\n\nIt is suspected that American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) oppose clearing out the GC Backlog because they make over a billion dollars annually in H1b renewal fees of Indians stuck in the backlog. Corporations dependent on H1b workers might also be covertly *opposing* the reform due to above mentioned incentives. **Your support is thus crucial in this uphill battle**.\n\n**So, I ask you to please:**\n\n* Proactively support immigration reforms to clear this discriminatory backlog.\n* Be vocal in raising awareness to this problem that affects everyone - Indians, Americans and other nationalities. It deserves to be a mainstream issue at this point after years of buildup.\n* Help with lobbying and other direct action for legislative reforms which cannot be conducted by visa-holders.\n\n**Current Reforms to Support &amp; Participate in:**\n\n* Build Back Better Act, House draft have provisions 60002-60005 that will address all these issues.\n   * 60002: Recapture 400k wasted GCs since 1992\n   * 60003: Allow early AOS for approved petitions &amp; exemption from country-caps for a fee.\n   * Read about it [here](https://www.cato.org/blog/build-back-better-act-immigration-provisions-summary-analysis). For action, join this [telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/IhD4czsLtNYzNjM5), or join efforts with [ImmigrationVoice](https://immigrationvoice.org/).\n   * This is in critical stage for action.\n* [EAGLE Act](https://eagleact.info/) \\- Eliminates country-caps.\n\n**Read More:**\n\n* [CATO: Immigration Wait Times from Quotas Have Doubled: Green Card Backlogs Are Long, Growing, and Inequitable](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/immigration-wait-times-quotas-have-doubled-green-card-backlogs-are-long)\n* [Similar explanation on SIIA website](http://7monthsvs70years.siia.us/)\n\n\\---\n\nEDIT: Adding an account of the human impact of this GC limbo.\n\n**Human Impact of the long GC Limbo:**\n\nIf you are born in the wrong country, i.e. a country with a large population of English speakers and computer skills:\n\n1 You will be officially systemically discriminated to never get a GC / citizenship in your lifetime. People will fail to even recognize this discrimination because it is embedded in the \\[arcane\\] laws and is not a popular issue yet.\n\n2 You will always be treated as a commodity as in your existence is only tolerated and tied with your employment, irrespective of your contribution, taxes, and achievements.\n\n3 You are not allowed to travel freely to your home country; your parents' health be damned! If you have NRI friends, ask them how many funerals they have missed!\n\nWhile you are in this GC limbo, the work visa has to be renewed every 2-3 years. Each time, you have to get it re-stamped from India to be able to enter US. So all international travel windows are hostages to visa renewal appointment availabilities in India &amp; rigid timelines of renewal. At the appointment you are treated like a temporary worker every time even if you have been working in the US for several years with an approved GC petition, and could get denied by an arbitrary window officer, upon which you have to deport your family from US.\n\n4. When your dependent spouse's H4-EAD (dependent visa work authorization) is revoked (which is constantly in peril), your spouse cannot work for the rest of their life, irrespective of their qualification. Most dependent spouses in this backlog are Indian women. So it fails woman empowerment.\n\n5. If you have small kids when you move here, they will have to move out of the country (legal immigrant children are not protected by DACA, only children of illegal immigrants are) when they become adults, and may only come back here as a foreign student who can only be at best in the same situation as you are but they can never be a citizen.\n\n6. If you lose your job for any reason, (sickness, accident, layoffs) uproot from here and get the hell out of this country in 60 days you moochers! Who wants bloodsuckers like you here, after paying taxes most of your adult life. Same thing if you die; your family has to self-deport all because you were born in the wrong country. Btw, this includes the death of doctors and nurses on H1B waiting for their GC who died fighting COVID-19 for ALL of us.\n\nHere's a few examples of deaths of Indians in the GC limbo whose families had to deport because they did not receive their GC in time just because they were Indian:\n\n* [https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/archive/diaspora/death-of-indian-techie-on-us-green-card-waiting-forces-pregnant-wife-to-return-home-855359](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/archive/diaspora/death-of-indian-techie-on-us-green-card-waiting-forces-pregnant-wife-to-return-home-855359)\n* [https://www.kansascity.com/opinion/readers-opinion/guest-commentary/article236572298.html](https://www.kansascity.com/opinion/readers-opinion/guest-commentary/article236572298.html)\n* [https://www.indiawest.com/news/global\\_indian/h-1b-engineer-dies-of-heart-attack-leaving-family-vulnerable-to-immediate-deportation-to-india/article\\_2bdc256a-f9ae-11eb-acf7-cb6aa459cc99.html](https://www.indiawest.com/news/global_indian/h-1b-engineer-dies-of-heart-attack-leaving-family-vulnerable-to-immediate-deportation-to-india/article_2bdc256a-f9ae-11eb-acf7-cb6aa459cc99.html)\n* [https://www.americanbazaaronline.com/2019/10/21/indian-national-stuck-in-green-card-limbo-forced-to-return-after-her-husbands-death-439102/](https://www.americanbazaaronline.com/2019/10/21/indian-national-stuck-in-green-card-limbo-forced-to-return-after-her-husbands-death-439102/)\n\n7 You cannot start a business; you exist only because of your quasi-\"temporary\" employment, remember? You or your kids are not allowed any side income (book royalty, lemonade stand, start-ups, freelancing, artistry sale, teaching math or robotics club .. no, nothing... nada)\n\nYou see, the bill of rights, the pursuit of happiness, freedom etc are simply not applicable to you. You exist because we have a slight skill shortage.\n\nThis is the situation for over 1 million people. But of course, the media does not acknowledge it as a civil right issue. Their sob stories are not as alluring on TV as refugees, not enough violence and horrors for TV footages. Of course, politicians don't care. You cannot vote or even provide campaign contributions by law. Neither do employers care,.. I mean, who wants to give these people more job mobility?\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**FAQs:**\n\nQ1. Since it is so repressive, why don't you go back to India or elsewhere?\n\n\\&gt; Ignoring the analogy of this question to a racist White person telling you to go back -\n\nYes I might. I am in my early 30s without a house or kids so I have more flexibility. But many people have laid down roots here already who do not have that flexibility.\n\nI too have been here for 8+ yrs with a friend circle &amp; a support network in the country, so it is hard to leave that. More importantly, I see a clear discrimination and violation of equality, and along with possibilities of reforms, it gives me hope to improve the system, and get what my qualification deserves.\n\nAlso, it's like a slow poison. Life is decent, we're making above-median salary, we're in the \"greatest\" country in the world, but it is slowly chipping away at us, depriving us of some freedom, entrepreneurship, creativity, community involvement, assimilation &amp; acceptance.\n\nLastly, if all the backlogged people decided to leave, no one would leave because game theory; it is not a feasible solution.\n\nQ2. Won't Indians dominate green cards resulting in lack of diversity if country caps are removed?\n\n\\&gt; The argument I make is limited to the Employment-based category of Green Cards which is just 14% of the total number of GCs available annually. Employment opportunities are based on market supply demand dynamics. Just because currently Indians satisfy the tech demand does not mean this will always be the case. Enforcing \"diversity\" on employment visas rather results in violation of equality of opportunity based on merit as explained above.\n\nMoreover, you can question, diversity of what? Diversity of culture? Diversity of race? Diversity of language? Diversity of socioeconomic status?\n\nCountries are not necessarily homogenous in their demographics. eg. India itself has many distinct languages, different cultures, different ethnicities, different races too. South Africa, Indonesia etc also rank high in diversity. So even if the argument is to control for diversity of demographics, country-of-birth based caps make no sense.\n\nQ3. Why would you come to the US in the first place if it is so bad?\n\n\\&gt; Generally Indians do not know how bad it is before coming here. Also, the situation got much worse over the last decade. More importantly though, every few years, there have been potential immigration reforms on the table which would fix this which gives hope. Only after living here for many years do you realize that it's a dangling carrot in front of you. Classic exploitation technique. If I had known this before I came to the US, clearly I would not have come, and I know most others wouldn't have either. For after we come here, see my answers for Q1.",

ABDs are citizens of the US, and like any other citizen they should make the decision that is in the best interest of the country. Blindly supporting someone because they came from the same country as your parents is the polar opposite of making a well-informed decision. Every country prioritizes the interests of its own people, the US isn’t special in any way. \n\nIt’s great that you and your family were able to become citizens, but they did so by going through the same immigration process as everyone else and likely faced their own struggles during that time. Adult immigrants are well aware of how immigration processes in other countries work and if they just choose to migrate regardless they can’t push the blame onto the host country when their future becomes uncertain. The only people who aren’t themselves responsible for being in this situation are legal dreamers, and they shouldn’t be held accountable for the actions of their parents. This post isn’t about that though it’s just an essay full of “woe is me the system is unfair and discriminatory” (when it really isn’t).",

People will fail to even recognize this discrimination because it is embedded in the \\[arcane\\] laws and is not a popular issue yet.\n\n2 You will always be treated as a commodity as in your existence is only tolerated and tied with your employment, irrespective of your contribution, taxes, and achievements.\n\n3 You are not allowed to travel freely to your home country; your parents' health be damned! If you have NRI friends, ask them how many funerals they have missed!\n\nWhile you are in this GC limbo, the work visa has to be renewed every 2-3 years. Each time, you have to get it re-stamped from India to be able to enter US. So all international travel windows are hostages to visa renewal appointment availabilities in India &amp; rigid timelines of renewal. At the appointment you are treated like a temporary worker every time even if you have been working in the US for several years with an approved GC petition, and could get denied by an arbitrary window officer, upon which you have to deport your family from US.\n\n4) When your dependent spouse's H4-EAD (dependent visa work authorization) is revoked (which is constantly in peril), your spouse cannot work for the rest of their life, irrespective of their qualification. Most dependent spouses in this backlog are Indian women. So it fails woman empowerment.\n\n5) If you have small kids when you move here, they will have to move out of the country (legal immigrant children are not protected by DACA, only children of illegal immigrants are) when they become adults, and may only come back here as a foreign student who can only be at best in the same situation as you are but they can never be a citizen.\n\n6) If you lose your job for any reason, (sickness, accident, layoffs) uproot from here and get the hell out of this country in 60 days you moochers! Who wants bloodsuckers like you here, after paying taxes most of your adult life. Same thing if you die; your family has to self-deport all because you were born in the wrong country. Btw, this includes the death of doctors and nurses on H1B waiting for their GC who died fighting COVID-19 for ALL of us.\n\nHere's a few examples of deaths of Indians in the GC limbo whose families had to deport because they did not receive their GC in time just because they were Indian:\n\n* [https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/archive/diaspora/death-of-indian-techie-on-us-green-card-waiting-forces-pregnant-wife-to-return-home-855359](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/archive/diaspora/death-of-indian-techie-on-us-green-card-waiting-forces-pregnant-wife-to-return-home-855359)\n* [https://www.kansascity.com/opinion/readers-opinion/guest-commentary/article236572298.html](https://www.kansascity.com/opinion/readers-opinion/guest-commentary/article236572298.html)\n* [https://www.indiawest.com/news/global\\_indian/h-1b-engineer-dies-of-heart-attack-leaving-family-vulnerable-to-immediate-deportation-to-india/article\\_2bdc256a-f9ae-11eb-acf7-cb6aa459cc99.html](https://www.indiawest.com/news/global_indian/h-1b-engineer-dies-of-heart-attack-leaving-family-vulnerable-to-immediate-deportation-to-india/article_2bdc256a-f9ae-11eb-acf7-cb6aa459cc99.html)\n* [https://www.americanbazaaronline.com/2019/10/21/indian-national-stuck-in-green-card-limbo-forced-to-return-after-her-husbands-death-439102/](https://www.americanbazaaronline.com/2019/10/21/indian-national-stuck-in-green-card-limbo-forced-to-return-after-her-husbands-death-439102/)\n\n7 You cannot start a business; you exist only because of your quasi-\"temporary\" employment, remember? You or your kids are not allowed any side income (book royalty, lemonade stand, start-ups, freelancing, artistry sale, teaching math or robotics club .. no, nothing... nada)\n\nYou see, the bill of rights, the pursuit of happiness, freedom etc are simply not applicable to you. You exist because we have a slight skill shortage.\n\nThis is the situation for over 1 million people. But of course, the media does not acknowledge it as a civil right issue. Their sob stories are not as alluring on TV as refugees, not enough violence and horrors for TV footages. Of course, politicians don't care. You cannot vote or even provide campaign contributions by law. Neither do employers care,.. I mean, who wants to give these people more job mobility?",

            "body": "I would like to add another perspective that doesn't seem to have been discussed or expressed clearly here.\n\nThe question for US is about American competitiveness in the world. All developed nations have a declining working population and the only way for them to survive in the long run is to have immigrants coming in. Ideally these developing nations want the most educated immigrants so that they have to spend the least money in educating them and then reap the most tax benefits during their working lives. In return US would be giving these immigrants much hire standard of living. In terms of this framework US is lagging behind other developed nations like Australia, NZ and Canada etc. who have much more open immigration policies as they have realized the problem they are facing.\n\nI personally won't call the current laws racist or segregationist as the original intent of these laws wasn't to distinguish between people. That's just something that US decided to do and I believe it's their right to decide which people come to their country. More indians becoming eligible for H1B jobs is no achievement, most who become eligible for these positions are themselves (including me) product of caste privilege that they have enjoyed in India. Being 'meritorious' doesn't give every H1B holder a right to become a US citizen. Ofcourse we would like that :), but it's the decision of the citizens of USA.\n\nSo I think it is just beneficial for US to give people GCs so they can express their economic potential to the fullest extent and thus benefit US in the long term. Similarly they should also increase the number of H1B visas issued per year.",

At this moment, the Build Back Better Act is a hope to [include immigration reforms](https://www.cato.org/blog/build-back-better-act-immigration-provisions-summary-analysis) which has passed the House in November. Senate Dems are working on including the section (60001) that provides relief to undocumented immigrants, but they have not yet worked on the sections (60002/3) that help clear the GC backlog for documented immigrants. Senator Durbin (D-IL) is the bottleneck who seems to want to include (60002/3) only if (60001) gets approved. It would help if you can call Sen Durbin (DC: 202-224-2152) and just ask him to support the sections 60002/3 and make a public statement saying he will work in good faith to pass them.\n\nLong term, [ImmigrationVoice.org](https://ImmigrationVoice.org) is the only organization that is working towards this cause since 15 yrs. You can make a donation on the website. They do some [lobbying work](https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/clients/summary?cycle=2021&amp;id=F194104) from the contribution money. Take a look at their [action items](https://immigrationvoice.org/action-items/) which mainly ask followers to call &amp; meet relevant senators because that's the most visa-holders can do. You can join their [telegram group](https://immigrationvoice.org/telegram/) to talk to members directly but they require you to fill in your contact info to make sure you are serious.\n\nApart from that, there is an open telegram group for discussing the latest events &amp; advocacy effort: [https://t.me/joinchat/ScOKt74bvh8Q88u5](https://t.me/joinchat/ScOKt74bvh8Q88u5).\n\nI personally think we are not well organized. Telegram groups are flat communication channels, and ImmigrationVoice could make it easier for new people (esp. those outside the backlogged community) who have no idea about everything. But that's what we have as of now, and we'll be making some efforts to organize ourselves better.",

        "selftext": "\n**A newly discovered IoT botnet named Ballista is exploiting vulnerabilities in TP-Link Archer routers and is associated with an unnamed Italian threat actor.**\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- Ballista exploits a vulnerability tracked as CVE-2023-1389, originally revealed during a hacking competition.\n- The botnet has been linked to attacks on organizations across several countries, including the US and Australia.\n- More than 6,000 internet-exposed devices may be vulnerable to this botnet's attacks.\n- The malware establishes a command and control channel to manipulate compromised devices for malicious activities.\n\nCato Networks recently identified Ballista, a new IoT botnet that specifically targets TP-Link Archer routers by taking advantage of a vulnerability known as CVE-2023-1389. This vulnerability was first disclosed during a Pwn2Own hacker competition held in late 2022 and has been exploited by various botnets since. The connection between Ballista and an unnamed Italian threat actor has been established with moderate confidence based on specific patterns in malware binaries and IP addresses. The botnet first surfaced in January 2025, with adverse activities observed shortly thereafter, suggesting it remains operational in the wild.\n\nThe Ballista botnet is particularly concerning because it targets a significant number of devices globally, including those in critical sectors such as manufacturing, healthcare, services, and technology. With over 6,000 devices potentially exposed to this botnet, organizations in areas like the US, Australia, China, and Mexico need to be vigilant. Upon successfully exploiting a vulnerable router, Ballista downloads a malicious payload that sets up an encrypted command and control channel. This enables the attackers to execute command-line instructions, spread the malware further, and even launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks while trying to evade detection by modifying download sources to use Tor domains for better concealment.\n\nWhat steps should organizations take to secure their devices against emerging IoT threats like the Ballista botnet?\n\n**Learn More:** [Security Week](https://www.securityweek.com/new-ballista-iot-botnet-linked-to-italian-threat-actor/)\n\n**Want to stay updated on the latest cyber threats?** \n\n 👉 **[Subscribe to /r/PwnHub](https://www.reddit.com/r/pwnhub)**",

        "title": "Theodore M. Porter and the Critique of Quantification",
        "selftext": "# Implications Theodore Porter’s Thinking in Psychotherapy and Mental Health\n\n\n\n# Who is Theodore Porter?\n\nIn his seminal work “Trust in Numbers: The Pursuit of Objectivity in Science and Public Life,” historian of science Theodore Porter offers a compelling analysis of the rise and cultural authority of quantitative methods in modern society. Porter challenges the prevailing assumption that the power and prestige of numbers derive solely from their success in the natural sciences. Instead, he argues that to fully understand the ubiquity of quantification, we must examine its ascendancy in the social realms of business, government, and public policy.\n\nPorter’s central thesis is that quantitative objectivity emerged not as an inherent feature of scientific progress, but as a “technology of distance” – a strategy for communicating across expanding social networks whose members could no longer rely on personal trust and reputation alone. The authority of numbers, he contends, is deeply entwined with the social contexts in which quantification is deployed, particularly when expert judgment is challenged and credibility is in doubt. Through a wide-ranging exploration of fields such as accounting, insurance, cost-benefit analysis, and engineering, Porter reveals how the ideal of mechanical objectivity often serves as a bulwark against accusations of arbitrariness or bias when decision-makers face external political pressures and a breakdown of trust.\n\n# The Facade of Neutrality\n\nWhile Porter acknowledges the genuine achievements of quantitative methods, he cautions against the temptation to view them as a panacea for the messy [realities of social and political life](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/4777-2/). The very ideal of a “view from nowhere,” purged of individual discretion and judgment, can easily become a smokescreen for the subtle manipulations of entrenched power. Under the guise of impartial, [evidence-based reasoning](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/when-evidence-based-practice-goes-wrong/), [bureaucratic hierarchies](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/fixing-evidence-based-practice/) and c[orporate interests](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/corporatization-of-psychotherapy/) can shape the [epistemic assumptions,](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/the-participatory-poetics-of-metamodern-language-and-culture/) methodological conventions, and discursive constraints that govern the production of quantitative knowledge.\n\nThis illusion of neutrality is perhaps most apparent in the realm of public policy, where the language of numbers is routinely invoked to justify controversial decisions and foreclosure of alternatives. Porter points to the rise of cost-benefit analysis as a prime example of how the narrow logic of economic quantification can steamroll ethical and ideological differences in the name of an “optimal” solution. By translating complex trade-offs between incommensurable values into a common metric of dollars and cents, policy-makers can lend an air of objective validity to what are ultimately political judgments about the distribution of risks and rewards across society.\n\nSimilarly, the proliferation of quantitative benchmarks and performance metrics in domains such as education and healthcare can serve to reinforce status quo power relations while disavowing the role of human agency and responsibility. The seductive appeal of “letting the numbers speak for themselves” can discourage critical interrogation of the value-laden assumptions built into evaluative rubrics and data collection processes. In this way, the pursuit of standardization and algorithmic decision-making can end up marginalizing forms of knowledge and experience that resist easy quantification, such as narrative, affect, and embodied wisdom.\n\n# Medicine: Evidence-Based or Industry-Driven?\n\nThe field of medicine provides a cautionary case study in the limits and pitfalls of quantitative objectivity. In recent decades, the ideal of evidence-based medicine (EBM) has gained increasing traction as a corrective to the traditional reliance on individual clinical expertise. Proponents of EBM argue that medical decision-making should be guided by systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses rather than anecdotal experience or expert opinion. This shift towards quantitative empiricism was partly a response to growing public skepticism towards medical authority in the wake of scandals over industry influence and conflicts of interest.\n\nHowever, as Porter’s analysis suggests, the rhetoric of EBM can also serve to mask the persistence of bias and the distortions of market forces in shaping medical knowledge and practice. The [STAR\\*D study](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/when-evidence-based-practice-goes-wrong/), a massive clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of antidepressant medications, illustrates the ways in which the presumed objectivity of q[uantitative evidence can be undermined by methodological choices](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/can-psychotherapy-survive-seperated-from-anthropology-and-philosophy/) and reporting practices. Despite its rigorous statistical methodology, the study has been criticized for its reliance on industry funding, selective publication of favorable results, and failure to adequately control for placebo effects. The aura of scientific validity conferred by the study’s quantitative framework has been invoked to justify the widespread prescription of antidepressants, even as questions remain about their efficacy and safety, particularly for mild to moderate depression.\n\nOn a broader level, the EBM paradigm risks neglecting crucial contextual factors that shape health outcomes, such as patient preferences, social determinants, and the therapeutic alliance. The drive to eliminate variations in care through rigid adherence to standardized guidelines can undermine the flexibility and judgment needed to tailor treatments to individual needs. Moreover, the emphasis on quantifiable outcomes may marginalize forms of care that resist easy measurement, such as empathy, narrative understanding, and holistic consideration of patient well-being. In this way, the uncritical pursuit of quantitative objectivity in medicine can ironically lead to a reductionist and dehumanizing view of the healing process.\n\n# Politics: The Quantitative Rhetoric of the Center\n\nIn the political sphere, the ideal of [quantitative objectivity has increasingly been mobilized to justify a narrow spectrum of centrist policy options](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/healing-the-modern-soul-part-2/) while foreclosing more expansive visions of social transformation. In recent years, the Democratic Party in the United States has embraced a technocratic, data-driven approach to governance that purports to transcend ideological differences through pragmatic problem-solving. This quantitative centrism is epitomized by the rise of figures such as Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, who have championed policies such as welfare reform, financial deregulation, and market-based healthcare on the grounds of economic efficiency and evidence-based policymaking.\n\nHowever, as Porter’s analysis suggests, this fetishization of quantitative expertise can serve to mask the value judgments and p[ower dynamics that shape political choices](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/anticipating-the-meta-modern-what-comes-after-the-post-modern/). By framing social issues in the technical language of cost-benefit analysis and statistical risk assessment, centrist Democrats have often shifted the Overton window to the right, legitimating the erosion of the welfare state and the marketization of public goods. The presumption that the correct policy must always lie somewhere in the [middle of two extremes](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/politics-trauma-and-psychology-oh-my/) can have the effect of marginalizing more progressive or transformative ideas as unrealistic or utopian.\n\nConservative and libertarian think tanks have weaponized the rhetoric of quantitative objectivity to provide an epistemic gloss to their preferred policy agendas. Organizations such as the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute, and the Manhattan Institute have produced a deluge of studies, reports, and policy briefs that use economic modeling, regression analysis, and other quantitative techniques to argue for tax cuts, deregulation, and the privatization of government services. By clothing their arguments in the garb of value-neutral science, these groups can lend an air of empirical legitimacy to what are ultimately contestable ideological positions.\n\nAmericas obsession with evidence based practice have allowed nefarious forces to turn our conception of economics into ideology plus math and our preference for evidence based practice into science flavored capitalism.\n\n# Psychology: The Violence of Pure Empiricism\n\nPerhaps the most troubling misapplication of quantitative objectivity can be found in the field of psychology, where the demand for complete empirical verification of mental phenomena can end up doing epistemic violence to the very subject matter it purports to illuminate. As a discipline concerned with the intricacies of human subjectivity and the interpreted nature of personal experience, psychology has long struggled to reconcile its scientific aspirations with the irreducible complexity of the mind. While quantitative methods have yielded important insights in domains such as cognitive neuroscience and behavioral genetics, the drive to operationalize every aspect of mental life into measurable variables can lead to a flattening and fragmenting of the psyche.\n\nThe dark side of psychology’s quantitative turn is perhaps most evident in the history of psychological [testing and assessment](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/the-failure-of-evidence-based-incentive-structure/). From the early 20th century onwards, the proliferation of standardized instruments such as IQ tests, personality inventories, and diagnostic questionnaires has often served to reify cultural stereotypes and legitimate the ranking of human worth along a single quantitative dimension. The aura of scientific objectivity conferred by numerical scores and statistical norms can mask the value-laden assumptions and interpretive judgments that are baked into these tools from the start. In this way, the quantitative gaze of psychology can end up [pathologizing difference, decontextualizing distress, and reducing the rich tapestry of human experience t](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/the-bridge-between-ancient-wisdom-and-modern-practice/)o a set of measurable deficits and abnormalities.\n\nMoreover, as Porter argues, the ideal of quantitative objectivity as a “view from nowhere” emerged historically as a defensive response to the erosion of personal trust and the growth of impersonal bureaucracy. When this standpoint of detached, suspicious observation is turned reflexively back onto the [self](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/healing-the-modern-soul-part-3/), it can lead to a profound alienation from one’s own inner life. The demand for complete third-person verification of every subjective claim can end up invalidating the epistemic authority of first-person experience, feeling, and intuition. By imposing the same norms of standardization and control on the mind that we apply to the natural world, we risk losing touch with the very qualities that make us human – our capacity for meaning-making, imagination, and empathic understanding.\n\nThis is not to suggest that psychology should abandon the pursuit of empirical rigor or eschew quantitative methods altogether. Rather, as Porter’s analysis implies, we need to cultivate a more reflexive and pluralistic understanding of what counts as valid psychological knowledge. This means recognizing the cultural and historical specificity of our methodological assumptions, the value-ladenness of our interpretive frameworks, and the ineradicable role of the human subject in the construction of psychological truth. It means acknowledging the epistemic limits of quantification and the importance of other modes of inquiry, such as qualitative interviews, focus groups, and first-person phenomenology. Above all, it means approaching the study of the mind with an attitude of humility, curiosity, and openness to the irreducible otherness of human experience.\n\n# Porter’s Ideas Compared to Other Critics of Rationalizism and Empericism\n\nTheodore Porter’s critique of quantification and objectivity has intriguing parallels and contrasts with the ideas of several other prominent thinkers who have examined the impact of technology, media, and bureaucracy on modern society.\n\n# Adam Curtis and the Critique of Computer-Based Societal Modeling\n\nBritish documentary filmmaker [Adam Curtis](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/adam-curtis-thesis-less-documentarian-and-art-films-that-are-more-than-journalism/) has argued that the increasing use of computers and data analysis in the late 20th century gave rise to a misguided belief that society could be perfectly understood and modeled using mathematical and computational methods. In his 2011 series “All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace,” Curtis suggests that this “cybernetic” view of the world, promoted by thinkers like Ayn Rand and Alan Greenspan, led to a misplaced faith in the power of markets and technology to solve social problems.\n\nPorter’s work resonates with Curtis’s critique in its skepticism towards the assumption that quantitative methods can provide a fully objective and comprehensive understanding of complex human realities. Both thinkers highlight the ways in which the appeal of numbers and data can obscure the subjective judgments and political interests that shape their application.\n\nHowever, while Curtis emphasizes the role of computers and cybernetics in promoting a mechanistic view of society, Porter’s analysis focuses more on the institutional and professional contexts that drive the pursuit of quantification. Porter’s distinction between mechanical and disciplinary objectivity suggests that the rise of numerical methods cannot be attributed solely to technological developments, but also reflects the social and political imperatives of bureaucracies and expert communities.\n\n# Jean Baudrillard and the Simulacra\n\nThe French philosopher and cultural theorist [Jean Baudrillard](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/jean-baudrillard-philosopher-of-hyperreality-and-simulation/) is known for his concept of “simulacra” – representations that have become detached from reality and taken on a life of their own. In his book “Simulacra and Simulation” (1981), Baudrillard argues that in the [postmodern](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/metamodernism-and-the-future-of-psychotherapy-integrating-modernity-postmodernity-and-the-therapeutic-encounter/) era, signs and images have lost their connection to real-world referents, creating a hyperreal world where simulation is more powerful than reality.\n\nBaudrillard’s ideas have intriguing implications for Porter’s critique of quantification. From a Baudrillardian perspective, the proliferation of numerical indicators and statistical models could be seen as a form of simulacra – abstract representations that have become more “real” than the complex social phenomena they purport to describe. The use of quantitative measures in fields like economics, policy, and mental health could be seen as creating a hyperreal world where decisions are based on simplified numerical proxies rather than direct engagement with human realities.\n\nHowever, while Baudrillard’s work often emphasizes the seductive power of simulation and the impossibility of accessing the “real,” Porter’s analysis suggests that quantification is always shaped by social and political contexts. Rather than seeing numbers as fully detached from reality, Porter emphasizes the ways in which quantitative methods are embedded in networks of expertise, accountability, and trust.\n\n# The Situationists and the Spectacle of Quantification\n\nThe [Situationist International](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/the-situationist-international-subversive-tricksters-of-everyday-life/) was a group of radical artists and theorists active in the 1950s and 60s, known for their critique of consumer capitalism and their advocacy of revolutionary social change. One of the key concepts developed by the Situationists was the idea of the “spectacle” – a term used to describe the way in which modern media and advertising create a false, alienated representation of reality that distracts from authentic human experience.\n\nThe Situationist critique of the spectacle has some intriguing parallels with Porter’s analysis of quantification. Just as the spectacle reduces human life to a series of commodified images, the proliferation of numerical indicators and statistical models could be seen as creating a kind of “spectacle of objectivity” – a seductive but ultimately alienating representation of social reality.\n\nHowever, while the Situationists emphasized the need for radical social and political transformation to overcome the spectacle, Porter’s work suggests that the pursuit of quantification is deeply embedded in the structures and practices of modern institutions. Rather than advocating for a complete rejection of numerical methods, Porter’s analysis invites a more nuanced consideration of how quantitative tools can be used in ways that are transparent, accountable, and responsive to human contexts.\n\n# Nietzsche and the Rational\n\nOne important point of comparison is with the work of [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/friedrich-nietzsches-profound-impact-on-psychology-psychotherapy-and-the-conceptualization-of-trauma/), whose genealogical approach to the history of ideas shares with Porter a skepticism towards claims of pure objectivity. Nietzsche’s critique of scientific rationality as a form of asceticism and self-denial, driven by a “will to truth” that serves particular interests and values, anticipates Porter’s examination of the moral and political dimensions of quantification. Like Porter, Nietzsche emphasizes the historical and psychological contingency of knowledge practices, revealing the ways in which the pursuit of truth is always entangled with questions of power and desire.\n\nHowever, Nietzsche’s critique is arguably more radical and far-reaching than Porter’s, calling into question the very value of objectivity and suggesting that all knowledge claims are ultimately expressions of a will to power. While Porter’s analysis is more focused on the specific contexts and practices of quantification, Nietzsche’s genealogical method aims to uncover the deeper moral and metaphysical roots of scientific thinking itself.\n\n# Michel Foucault and the Social Objective\n\nAnother key thinker whose work intersects with Porter’s is [Michel Foucault](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/post-freudian-psychoanalysis-ronald-fairbairn/), particularly in his analyses of the relationship between knowledge and power. Foucault’s concept of the “power/knowledge nexus” emphasizes the ways in which the production of knowledge is always intertwined with networks of power relations, shaping the possibilities for thought and action in a given historical moment. This perspective resonates with Porter’s examination of how quantitative methods have been employed in the service of bureaucratic administration and governance, from public health and education to criminal justice and social welfare.\n\nLike Porter, Foucault is attentive to the role of quantification in the management of populations and the disciplining of individual subjectivities. He shows how statistical norms and standards, presented as objective and neutral, can function as instruments of power, shaping the ways in which people understand and govern themselves. At the same time, Foucault’s work encompasses a broader range of knowledge practices and power relations than Porter’s more specific focus on quantification, and his emphasis on the ontological and political effects of knowledge production differs from Porter’s more epistemological and professional concerns.\n\nMichel Foucalt\n\n# Legacy of Porter’s Ideas\n\nTheodore Porter’s critique of quantification offers a valuable perspective for examining the use of numerical methods in psychotherapy and mental health. His work challenges the assumption that quantification is inherently objective and neutral, highlighting the social, political, and institutional factors that shape the application of statistics and standardized procedures.\n\nIn the context of psychotherapy, Porter’s ideas invite a critical reflection on the evidence-based practice movement, diagnostic systems, and the therapeutic relationship. While quantitative methods can provide important insights and support accountability, an overreliance on these approaches can also constrain the understanding and treatment of psychological distress.\n\nAs the mental health field grapples with the challenges of providing effective, equitable, and humane care, engaging with Porter’s work can inform the development of more nuanced and contextually-sensitive approaches. This may involve balancing the use of standardized interventions with the cultivation of clinical judgment, attending to the social and cultural determinants of mental health, and prioritizing the therapeutic alliance as a key factor in outcomes.\n\nUltimately, a critical understanding of the role of quantification in psychotherapy can support the delivery of care that is both evidence-based and person-centered, and that honors the complexity and diversity of human experience.\n\n# References:\n\nPorter, T.

Therapists work with individuals, not abstractions like “the average member of X group.” While quantitative methods are indispensable, they must be balanced with qualitative outcomes. Funnily enough, this aligns with what radical behaviorists have long argued for (though often failed to achieve): the need to center experience and behavior as the target of research and intervention.\n\nQuantifying is crucial, but as Marx and Engels noted, qualitative changes can transform into quantitative ones. The problem arises when therapists misinterpret critiques of quantitative methods as a license to reject them outright in favor of “clinical judgment,” a concept largely debunked as unreliable. It’s this kind of binary thinking—rejecting half of a complex picture—that leads to the current issues in quantification.\n\nUltimately, the goal of science in clinical work isn’t to merely apply an existing body of knowledge to one’s work but to apply scientific principles to the work itself. Measurement or tracking of SOME kind is invaluable, not only for holding oneself accountable to actual outcomes (as opposed to the typically imagined ones) but also for better understanding and refining one’s own processes as a therapist or an active agent in the world.",

The facility is one of the nation's largest such detention sites and has a capacity of 1,900 inmates, comprised of both men and women.\n\n\n\nThe Current reached out to the South Texas ICE Processing Center in Pearsall for a response to the claims of abuse but received no response by press time.\n\n\n\nWired reports that from January through May, more than 80 emergency calls originated from the facility, including several regarding suicide attempts. One 36-year-old man reportedly swallowed 20 over-the-counter pills, while another detainee, 37, ingested cleaning chemicals and a third, 41, was found cutting himself. \n\n\n\nOther calls involved pregnant women bleeding or suffering severe pain, according to the magazine's data dive. ICE detention is linked to heightened rates of pregnancy complications — both for the child and mother — according to research by the peer-reviewed JAMA Network of medical publications.\n\nWhile official ICE policy generally discourages detaining pregnant individuals, ICE booked 158 pregnant, postpartum and nursing people over a six-month period ending early last spring, according to federal data.\n\n\n\nJonathan Ryan, a San Antonio immigration attorney and former CEO of RAICES, told the Current that the 9-1-1 calls emanating from the Pearsall Center are a tactic by GEO Group to avoid cutting into profit margins by administering in-house medical treatment.\n\n\n\n\"You always have to remember that these are for-profit detention facilities,\" Ryan said. \"These are corporations that are profit-based, and medical care is expensive. And so even if they have the facilities to provide medical care, if they are able to offload those services to the local community, they're going to do that because that's more money in their pockets.\"\n\n\n\nRyan continued: \"You do everything you can to avoid spending money on the people who are detained there. And that's a race to the bottom in terms of safety and sanity and health for anybody who is unfortunate enough to be stuck inside of those facilities.\"\n\n\n\nThe JAMA Network's report showed a high rate of preventable deaths at ICE detention facilities nationwide due to inadequate medical care. Most deaths were people under 43 with no co-morbidities, and one-half of the deaths were due to preventable causes, such as COVID-19 and suicide.\n\n\"Systematic substandard care has been identified as a factor associated with these deaths, including lack of recognition of severe illness, medical staff dismissal of concerns about individuals’ health, and delays in activating external emergency care,\" the report states.\n\n\n\nRyan, who's dealt with cases at the Pearsall facility since it opened in 2005, said he's frequently heard of its on-site medical facility prescribing water for a slew of health problems.\n\n\n\n\"But you also see in some instances over-medication, and that particularly is in terms of things like psychotropic medicine,\" Ryan said. \"And I've on many occasions seen my clients zombified in those facilities because they're being pumped up with psychotropic medicines that the facility uses in order to practically render catatonic anyone who doesn't follow their orders and doesn't comply with their regimen of rules in the facilities.\"\n\nThe number of 9-1-1 calls originating from the South Texas ICE Processing Center tripled in March, according to Wired. However, the magazine noted that a number of factors could have contributed to the jump, including worsening conditions, increased willingness to dial 9-1-1 or a surge in population. In one week, dispatchers fielded 11 separate calls from the facility.\n\n\n\nIn one such call, a woman complained that her husband detained inside had been too weak to get out of bed all day and \"they have not helped,\" Wired reports. Another dispatch from the facility in March was due to a report of sexual abuse identified as \"staff on detainee,\" according to the story.\n\n\n\nIn addition to 9-1-1 calls made from the facility, detainees' family members have taken to leaving negative Google reviews in apparent hope their cries for help reach the world at large.\n\n\n\n\"The detention is really bad, \\[nobody\\] hear\\[s\\] us, \\[today\\] all the inmate\\[s\\] stop\\[ped\\] eating food,\" Respina Saze wrote a week ago in a review of the Pearsall site. “Detainees have launched a hunger strike demanding justice and urgent review of their cases. \\[T\\]here is no \\[human\\] right\\[s\\]! And \\[nobody\\] answer\\[s.\\] \\[W\\]e are worry about our \\[family\\] member.\"\n\n\"This place does not know what it’s doing,\" said another one-star review, left a month ago by Tami Dube. \"\\[Y\\]ou call\\[,\\] ask questions and you get transferred to phone numbers that don’t even exist. People get sick or hurt and they’re not medically attended to. You try to bond them out and people have to wait 6+ hours just to be turned away 2 hours before closing.\"\n\n\n\nAs of this week, ICE is holding a record 59,000 detainees throughout the country as part of President Donald Trump's aggressive immigration crackdown, according to CBS News. Historical data gathered by the Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization covering the criminal justice system, indicates that it's the largest population of immigrant detainees in the nation's history.\n\n\n\nOf the 204,297 people ICE booked into detention since the start of the fiscal year, 65% have no criminal convictions and 93% have no violent convictions, according to data compiled by CATO Institute, the libertarian think tank. Among those who do have prior convictions, 53% fall into the categories of immigration, traffic-related offenses and non-violent vice crimes.",

        "selftext": "Remote work was never the issue. It worked. People were getting more done. They were less stressed, more focused. The skies were cleaner. Families were spending real time together again. Traffic vanished, the air was breathable, and for one brief moment, people saw what life could be if we weren’t shackled to a gas tank.\n\nAnd then the reversal came. Executives, media talking heads, and even your friends started parroting the same garbage:\n“It’s bad for culture.”\n“We need face time.”\n“Back to normal.”\n\nBut here’s the truth: it had nothing to do with culture.\nIt was oil.\nPlain and simple.\n\nWhen We Stopped Driving, They Started Panicking\n\nIn 2020, oil demand collapsed. U.S. gas usage dropped to the lowest level since 1969. [EIA, 2020]. ExxonMobil posted a $22 billion loss. Chevron lost $11 billion. BP slashed its dividend for the first time in a decade.\n\nThese companies weren’t just losing money—they were watching their entire model break.\nAnd guess what caused it?\nYou. Not driving.\n\nSo they fought back. Not with commercials. Not with honesty. But with influence. The American Petroleum Institute increased its lobbying spend in 2021. Quiet money went to think tanks like the Heritage Foundation, the American Enterprise Institute, and the Cato Institute—all of which have taken millions in fossil fuel donations. [Greenpeace Exxon Files, SourceWatch]. And from there came the messaging war: “Remote work is lazy,” “We’re losing productivity,” “You can’t innovate from home.”\n\nIt wasn’t a coincidence. It was coordinated.\n\nJoe Manchin. Ron DeSantis. Trump. The Usual Oil Puppets.\n\nSenator Joe Manchin, Democrat in name only, took over $1.5 million from fossil fuel donors. He’s personally profited from a coal company run by his family. In 2022, he demanded federal workers end remote work and return to their desks. That’s not leadership. That’s someone cashing a check.\n\nRon DeSantis, darling of the right and oil lobbyist wet dream, took nearly $10 million from fossil-fuel-aligned PACs between 2020 and 2022. His stance? Force schools and agencies open, kill off remote infrastructure, and attack climate regulation at every turn. His backers include the Uihlein family, owners of major shipping and fuel logistics operations, and Richard Uihlein in particular is known for pouring cash into anti-remote, pro-industry candidates.\n\nDonald Trump? That man was practically raised by Exxon. His Secretary of State? Rex Tillerson, former CEO of ExxonMobil. His rollback of EPA standards? A gift to Chevron. His push to “reopen the economy” during a mass-death pandemic? A desperate move to resuscitate oil demand.\n\nAnd then there’s the megaphone crew:\nJoe Rogan is the perfect example of how culture and power intertwine. Rogan isn’t an oil shill per se—but he’s hosted dozens of right-wing guests who are. He platformed Jordan Peterson (funded by Koch-aligned think tanks), Ben Shapiro (backed by The Daily Wire, partially funded by fossil-aligned billionaires), and Vivek Ramaswamy, who’s directly invested in fossil fuels. In his interviews, Rogan consistently talks about how remote work “feels lazy,” that people “need routine,” that cities need to “get back to normal.”\n\nHe’s not pushing oil. But the oil lobby doesn’t need a spokesman—they need a vibe.\nAnd Rogan sells it well.\n\nHe helps normalize the same “back to work” energy that fills gas stations and coffers.\n\nThe Media Was Paid to Sell You the Lie\n\nYou started seeing anchors, especially on CNBC and Bloomberg—networks flooded with car, airline, and fossil fuel ads—asking if remote work had “gone too far.” Meanwhile, oil ads ran every commercial break. Shell. Chevron. BP. Telling you they were “part of the solution.”\n\nNo. They were the reason for the problem. They wanted you back in traffic. Burning gas. Sitting in rush hour. Buying $6 lattes. Pumping dollars into a machine that profits every time you suffer.\n\nAnd it worked. Not because it made sense—but because it was louder. They outspent the truth.\n\nRemote Work Was a Revolution—and They Crushed It\n\nWhen people stayed home, productivity rose. Families got time back. Pollution dropped so dramatically NASA satellites captured it. [NASA, 2020].\nLos Angeles had smog-free skies.\nDelhi saw blue for the first time in decades.\n\nAnd the people who benefited most from this new world?\n\t•\tThe disabled.\n\n\t•\tThe immunocompromised.\n\n\t•\tParents of young kids.\n\n\t•\tAnyone without money for daily commuting, \n\nparking, or “office clothes.”\n\nSo what happened? The system—fueled by oil, defended by politicians, and normalized by media—ripped it away. All so Chevron could stop losing money.\n\nAnd we let them.\n\nWhat You Can Do Before They Take More\n\nYou’re not powerless. But you do need to start seeing who’s really behind the curtain. Here’s what matters:\n\t\n•\tCall out the names: Joe Manchin. Ron DeSantis. The Kochs. The Heritage Foundation. They don’t work for you—they work for fossil fuels.\n\n\t•\tSupport companies that stay remote-first.\n\n\t•\tVote like your lungs and freedom depend on \nit, because they do.\n\n\t•\tDon’t let the Rogans of the world shape the \nvibe unchecked.\n\n\t•\tAsk who benefits every time someone tells you “it’s time to return.”\n\n\nThey needed your engine running to keep their heart beating.\n\nWe had a glimpse of something better. And they killed it. Not because it was broken. But because it worked.\n.\n",

            "body": "I'm somewhat knowledgeable about the various pressures that resulted in a widespread pushback against remote work. I've been practicing law long enough to remember the GFC's impact to commercial real estate and how that shifted the mergers and acquisitions bargaining power in ways that few predicted, and even fewer thought it could happen so rapidly. It's no surprise that I keep a close eye on certain markets. Everything listed is all accurate, though if there were one I'd label as primary, it was because the sheer number of office space renewals that were coming due. Tldr below. \n\n\nMost all the leases that could be punted with short term extensions or \"act of god\" clauses have done so to the limit. These are typically negotiated as 20 year leases, so some were signed during the real estate boom from the mid 2000's. Tenants were asking for unprecedented discounts/concessions and some were simply not interested in renewing at all. This wasn't going to be a localized matter where some investors lose this round, maybe win the next. This rapid devaluation of assets would have potential to spread negative consequences to every industry and most all households. \n\n\nThere's a reason that political parties can't agree that water is wet, yet have explicitly or tacitly approved of return to work policies. There's simply so much money tied up in it that it created a consensus of business leaders and those with political power to act jointly to preserve something closer to the status quo than sit idle. Politicians would be accused of repeating Nero's mistakes and there aren't many business leaders who want things to change. That's a lot of momentum behind solutions like bailouts or return to work policies.\n\n\nThe historically predictable commercial lease market was about to be reset and that would have financially crippled lending, thus the markets, and there's little safety net left at the Fed. Business and politics had incentive to proactively soften any shakeup in bargaining power between the owners and tenants. Commercial real estate is what I imagine people picture when mentioning something is \"too big to fail.\" I don't like to say that, but facts care very little for what I like. \n\n\nEvidence supports that allowing this market to undergo significant changes will hurt everyone to some degree, so even minimum wage workers without any investments or jobs in cities have reason to plug their nose and support artificially propping up certain sectors. Return to work was what business and politics largely agreed upon as the best solution. \n\n\nIt's not hyperbole to say that the commercial real estate market, if allowed to enter freefall downward, would cause something akin to the Great Depression, maybe worse. Big law firms get paid well to stay on top of these things, and there were a lot of very scary projections that were rapidly shifting from speculation to reality. These aren't the types who jump at everything the Fed says or even sweat administration changes. When they are getting very seriously worried, it was time to actually worry.\n\n\nThese leases are meant to be very stable investments and that focus is in the parties minds. Accordingly, temporary market instability is not going to move the needle too much. It's a different story if there are massive vacancy rates with no indication that things will change. Remote work was that rare event that would have crumbled commercial leases as they constantly underbid each other to attract tenants. This isn't a situation where it's just Blackrock and other big investors that take the hit though. The markets are too tightly intertwined. \n\n\nWhether this was the natural product of capitalism or created and implemented by K Street isn't something I pretend to know. Unfortunately, it means one issue becomes a contagion problem for more than just those invested or otherwise connected to the industry. It's political suicide to let a large sector crash. Commercial real estate leases is a market measured in trillions. If we thought 2008 was bad... \n\n\nThe failure of one previously stable asset would have forced large companies to drastically lower their projected cash flow, among other things. Asset holders often borrow as much as possible because fully utilizing leverage is often more profitable. Borrowing power is determined by many factors, including reasonably projected revenues. This exposes the banks to risk as they also make assumptions about default rates, etc. While the corner hot dog vendor predictably sees a downturn, so does the rural diner that would presumably be more insulated from the impact.\n\n\nWith interest rates high, there was no was to refinance out of this and the consequences would have brought the financial system to a near standstill, especially since the Fed \"fired all its bullets\" when it had to combat the lockdowns. There's little room left to stimulate the economy again. The freefall of most all asset prices would be felt by most everyone. Rampant inflation is the only other alternative, and that's even less politically popular. Return to work is perhaps the only viable solution to those with wealth and power.\n\n\nTldr: if commercial vacancy rates skyrocket, it's a going to cause a huge, long lasting financial meltdown that makes the COVID dip look like a hiccup. Because the pain hurts almost everyone instead of just wealthy investors, business and politicians had huge incentives to preserve the value and stability of this market and pushing people to return to work accomplishes this.",

The only thing I've learned from the RTO push is how much of our economy is dependent on people just going into the office.  All the biggest industries have their hands in it. It's insurance, oil, real estate. On the RE side, they can't have commercial RE going down and RTO solves 2 issues, keeping the price of commercial and residential RE up. On the driving side, car insurance agencies and oil lobbies are motivated to keep people in the office. For the politicians, they need to keep the balance sheets looking good. Also, if people stat home and have energy,  they have energy to think, organize and question why we do things the way we do and even maybe start businesses which we can't have. Almost everyone in power right now has an incentive to RTO so they'll hide it behind culture or socializing or productivity or something but really it's about self interest. RTO doesn't have one answer, it has many different ones. It's trying to fight against a hydra and only focusing on the head in the middle. No one person is right about the answers and it depends on the company. ",

In fact global oil consumption only dropped by 9% in 2020 from the previous year of 2019, and has steadily increased every year to where we are now exceeding 2019 by 5%...\n\nBefore you make such an assertion perhaps you should really do some research.\n\nAs for your \"more productive\" claim lol, yes there are some people who can perform better without the distractions and stress of the workplace environment. However, this accounts for an extremely small percentage of people working from home because it takes a mind who is motivated and has initiative and for the most part people are children and lack these qualities therefore they need to be under constant supervision.",

Some people genuinely need to have at least a hybrid schedule, especially if they discussed needing accomodations pror to taking the job. I see both sides and would be in the office everyday if I could but my body wont let me. I think it was cruel of Trump to push this so far in the opposite direction because it impacted local politicians and the negativity towards telework almost died. Work is just not worth killing myself for. In defense of hybrid and telework, I work more hours on days from home (2 hours of commute time back) and ai am much more productive - can focus, do not physicall hurt or have legs swelling, and no distractions. However, I umderstand the bigger picture and communication overall work best from an office. Hoping I can start my own firm someday and just work from home minus client meetings.",

And he's not selling cookies.\" - Peter Greene, Little Rock Arkansas English Teacher, 2015 \n\n**TL;dr - Apes I am floored. All the big players are here and they're all in cahoots with BCG's Corporate Education plan, \"America's Education System at a Crossroads: New Research and Insights on Business-Educator Partnerships in PreK-12 Education.\" Who hired the overpriced consultants?: Bill Gates, The Walton Family, Jeffrey Yass, Betsy Devos, Mitt Romney, Benjamin Netanyahu, Jeb Bush, and many many new names to dive into.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3pln2r8v75s81.png?width=777&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84617b356a6a5100c2eee46dd85e3f6d008872b9\n\n**I think RC might be taking on \"The Big Three\", the world's three largest strategy** **consulting firms** **because they are nepotic and inter-connected at an elite level:** \n\n* **McKinsey &amp; Company**\n* **Boston Consulting Group**\n* **Bain &amp; Company**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ph72ksuoa5s81.png?width=1734&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74dd986961d3e7714b951cca6b8f57d9d84312fc\n\n **THE YASS NETWORK IN ACTION**\n\nLate last year, at a Renaissance Charter Stetson Middle School event, the **Gates Foundation** reappeared in Philly, not to announce that the New Media Technology charter school it founded with the Black Alliance for Educational Options (BAEO) was being managed by a criminal, but to promise $100,000 and possibly more to help Mayor Nutter and the SRC start the Philadelphia Great Schools Compact. A new accountability program and signed deal between traditional and charter schools, the compact establishes an Office of Charter Schools and promotes, thanks to  the newly formed Philadelphia School Partnership, a parochial school agenda.  Philadelphia School Partnership is a fund raising, school assessment group that seeks to convert low-performing schools into corporate factories and religious institutions.\n\n**Both the Gates and BCG plans for Philly are right on target with the Philadelphia School Partnership’s corporate/voucher plot.**\n\nThe Philadelphia School Partnership’s (PSP) corporatist/voucher/charter connections run deep. One PSP board member, **Janine Yass**, founded the Boys’ Latin School in 2007, where lawmaker Anthony Williams’ former staffer and BAEO member Dawn Chavous is now secretary of its board. Along with Kevin Chavous (DFER/BAEO leader and cousin to Dawn), Chris Whittle (formerly of Edison Schools), and Jeanne Allen (past Corbett adviser), **Janine Yass sits on the board of directors for the Center for Education Reform (CER)**, a pro-choice group launched in D.C. in 1993. In fact, Yass’ love affair with CER goes back to at least 2006, when she, past Bush Secretary of Education Rod Paige, New York City Schools Chancellor Joel Klein, Sallie Mae founder Al Lord, then-Indiana Republican state senator Teresa Lubbers, and others were celebrated for anti-public school accomplishments.\n\n**Janine is married to Susquehanna International Group’s Jeff Yass, a big funder of anti-public school groups across the country.** Along with Jeff’s partner Arthur Dantchik, Janine Yass donated $1,000 to Dan Harvell’s unsuccessful 2006 run for the GOP primary in House District 7, South Carolina. Blogger Gervais S. Bridges has found that, in this race, 86% of Harvell’s campaign funding came from out-of-state voucher supporters. Americans for Limited Government’s Howard Rich, who currently sits with Jeff Yass on the Cato Institute’s board, also tossed $1,000 to Harvell’s voucher campaign.\n\nsource:  [In the City of Corporate Love and Beyond: The Boston Consulting Group, Gates, and the Filthy Rich – Common Errant (btownerrant.com)](http://btownerrant.com/2012/05/18/in-the-city-of-corporate-love-and-beyond-the-boston-consulting-group-gates-and-the-filthy-rich/) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wn02lgv3d5s81.png?width=1225&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bb3df82388b5369eb6a7a6e8eca966de2d6a558\n\n**BCG’S SISTER CITES: THE CORPORATE SCHOOL PLAN FOR CLEVELAND AND PHILLY**\n\nThis month, Cleveland’s Mayor Frank Jackson is attempting to persuade the Ohio state legislature to buy into a corporate school transformation plan that BCG and others have been setting in motion since 2009.\n\n**In Cleveland, BCG has utilized the same slash-and-burn tactics as in Philly.**\n\nTo set up the kill, BCG’s 2009 Cleveland plan  (PDF ), which also included “reports” on school turnarounds from Education First and theme schools from the Council of the Great City Schools, doesn’t detail cost-saving strategies.\n\n**BCG AT THE PEARLY GATES**\n\nIn Illinois, BCG sold itself to the **Gates Foundation**, Joyce Foundation, Education First, and several sell-out leaders to help launch Advance Illinois. On the Advance Illinois board, BCG’s senior partner and managing director Marin Gjaja joined former Illinois governor Jim Edgar and State Farm’s Edward B. Rust, Jr., the former chair of the Business Roundtable’s Education Initiative and a McGraw-Hill board member, who has been on the public schools’ enemy list for years. In January 2012, just months after Advance Illinois aided in Stand for Children’s legislative buyout by spreading reform propaganda, BCG’s Shalini Unnikrishnan addressed the Illinois Joint Interim Task Force on Accountable Schools concerning the Illinois school report card, alongside Advance Illinois’ Robin Steans, daughter of Harrison Steans, the chairman of the executive committee at Financial Investments Corporation who sat on Mayor Daly’s charter school-expanding Renaissance School Fund board.  BCG revamped the Illinois school report card in 2011 by organizing 60 state-wide focus groups, but this wasn’t the firm’s first Illinois rodeo. In fact, in 2005, as CEO Arne Duncan applauded, the Gates Foundation paid BCG and the American Institutes for Research $2.3 million to devise a managing “portfolio” for the Chicago Public Schools.\n\n**Gates rehired BCG to write the proposal (PDF) for North Carolina’s Race to the Top bid**, after he bankrolled the firm’s 2007 North Carolina District and School Transformation plan.\n\n**In 2009, in order to win a $100 million Gates grant to set up an anti-teacher plan in Florida, Hillsborough County Schools hired, with Gates Foundation money, BCG to do focus groups**, survey teachers and administrators, and write up the grant proposal. For community engagement meetings in February and May 2010, besides BCG and Gates representatives, several members of the United Way were on hand, too, as they are in Philly. Hillsborough won the Gates Foundation Empowering Effective Teachers Grant, and the Hillsborough County Teachers Association willingly signed on.\n\n**BCG won the gig to develop the “teacher effectiveness” system for Hillsborough, too.** BCG and Gates have been involved in “boosting teacher effectiveness” in Prince George’s County Public Schools in Maryland and “improving student outcomes” in the Los Angeles Unified School District.\n\n**According to currently available tax records, since 2008 Gates has paid BCG $35.5 million.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sigq4ftke5s81.png?width=1450&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c00185da642a244b101df5b180f997eab63c5d75\n\n**Boston Consulting Group: Another Dark Horseman**\n\nWord went out today that immediately after Arkansas decided to make Little Rock Schools non-public, the **Walton family** called a \"focus group\" meeting \"in conjunction with the Boston Consulting Group. This is worse than finding the slender man in the back of your family portrait. For a public school system, this is finding the grim reaper at your front door. And he's not selling cookies.\n\nThe Boston Consulting Group is often referred to as \" management consulting group.\" That's not entirely accurate. BCG is one of The Big Three consulting groups-- the other two are McKinsey and Bain. People love working there, and the people who work there are recruited heavily from the very toppest universities. These are the guys that Fortune 500 companies call for help making money. Forbes lists them as America's 112th largest private company. Gutting and stripping school districts does not even require a tenth of their power or attention. They are officially scary.\n\nsource:  [CURMUDGUCATION: Boston Consulting Group: Another Dark Horseman](https://curmudgucation.blogspot.com/2015/01/boston-consulting-group-another-dark.html?m=1) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1lta1ysxe5s81.png?width=1103&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85ba08024047e6a5c0aabca9deffdc66204766ab\n\nsource:  [Walton Foundation sets meeting in Little Rock schools - Arkansas Times (arktimes.com)](https://arktimes.com/arkansas-blog/2015/01/31/walton-foundation-sets-meeting-in-little-rock-schools) \n\n**Diane Ravitch,** a former school reform advocate who now deplores the takeover of American education by the billionaire reformers, [has written on her popular blog in the past](http://dianeravitch.net/2012/12/03/beware-the-boston-consulting-group/) about the arrival of **Boston Consulting Group** in other school districts. It can be expected to  recommend privatized schools, as it has done in Memphis and Philadelphia. Ravitch wrote: \n\n**Wherever the Boston Consulting Group goes, certain outcomes are predictable:**\n\n**1. It will recommend closing public schools.**\n\n**2. It will recommend opening privately managed charter schools.**\n\n**3. Most of the schools closed will be in African-American neighborhoods.**\n\n**4. Most of the teachers laid off will be African American.**\n\n**5.

I haven’t read the whole post yet &amp; will tomorrow, so if you said anything about the conservatives anti-trans youth political BS &amp; connection to this please forgive me. I smooth, sleepy ape 🦧 I promise my story connects to BCG’s goal to destroy public schools!\n\nI’m happy to elaborate more, but in short I have a 13 year old trans son who is the most beautiful human in the world. I grew up in Florida so I’m kinda obsessed with Desantis, Don’t Say Gay, and all of the conservative hate targeting trans kids just like mine. If I lived in Texas they’d try to take my kid away from me. I hate this place.\n\nIn doing my research, I came across the theory that Florida’s law is basically a ploy to encourage a multitude of lawsuits against the public school district, eventually bankrupting the school system &amp; funneling funds into private Christian (aka white) schools. And the casualties are trans kids. LIKE MINE. \n\nMy Master’s degree is in clinical psychology &amp;  all of the research shows that laws like these, even just TALKING about laws like these raises trans youth suicide rates. They’re already killing themselves at disproportionate rates. I don’t just want my kid to live, ALL trans kids deserve to live &amp; thrive!!!\n\nThis connection you’ve made is blowing my mind because now it’s more personal than it’s ever been for me. It’s my baby &amp; all of the kids like him. They’re throwing trans kids under the bus &amp; it’s literally life or death. \n\nI DON’T HAVE WORDS FOR MY RAGE AT THESE FUCKERS. I feel RC’s last tweet in my soul.\n\nThank you OP for this connection. It fuels my anger but also gives me a little peace for some strange reason ❤️",

Well the cops or mayor leaked the info to some wannabe biker douche, and I shit you not 800-1000 people showed up to counter protest us with assault rifles, body armor, American flags, etc. They literally marched through town and surrounded our small group of families with kids, my gf and I, and some other folks from the community. They went from just screaming at us, to ripping signs from our hands and trying to steal all our things, to flat out assaulting multiple of us right in front of the entire towns police force(like 6 guys). I got punched in the face, thrown in the street and hit in the leg with a bat or something. My gf got sucker punched at the same time along with multiple others, even a teenage girl that was under 18 was attacked.\n\nThe cops didn't do a god damn thing and we were honestly lucky to even get out of there and back to out house without anyone following us. There's multiple videos of what happened, but the only real thing to come of it was a middle school teacher lost her job for being seen on a video yelling racist things directly to a girl.

I wanted to be a teacher once, I took the teach grant and taught in one of those black neighborhood schools you speak about. I wont name specifics to avoid doxing myself but the place was falling apart and the other teachers did not care. Many of my 4th grade students could not read. The school was getting plenty of money in fact it was getting most of the grant money in the district but the local superintendent was using it to buy stuff for themself and for useless bloat positions for their friends. While that may sound familiar to the topic its only coincidence as the individual went straight from academia to the position. No pitstops at bcg.\n\n I did not make the year and I quit and repaid the grant. Common core is a crime against education. It took leaving the states and going to other countries to see just how bad it is, I have had to basically re-learn math and chemistry from scratch. I showed my indian roomates my high school math textbook and they told me to my face I was scammed they had learned the same content in 6th grade. You will find no ally of public schools in this ape. \n\nSchool choice should be paramount what alot of public school supporters seem to forget is that the greatest champions of school choice are minority and ethnic populations. An IEP in my class had the mother come to me  and say she wished she had been able to send her daughter to tge next school over which had a more comprehensive special ed program But she could not. This is getting really close to political and I hate that because I have railed against it myself. But your entire post which while I am really glad for the info and encourage further digging comes with the supposition that public schools are some noble thing that people should be railing to defend. The BCG did not start this decline, it has been festering and coming for decades if you look into it. But they are certainly taking advantage of it and they should be looked over with a fine toothed comb. But dont pretend they are responsible for a mess that has too many factors involved going back too many years.  End rant I have said my piece.",

It was all treasonous and traitorous from top to bottom.\n\nThe primary aspects of the Trump coup were to have favorable governors and Secretaries of State declare \"election irregularities,\" which would give cover for state legislators to provide a slate of illegal, false electors. This is the most critical component and thoroughly undermines the ignorant doofus theory you posit above. When the false elector scheme failed, Trump resorted to pressuring governors and SoS' directly, to illegally manufacture votes from whole cloth.\n\nIn light of those failures, Trump pressured VP Pence to refuse to acknowledge electors from the swing states that Biden won, to either push for a contingent election in the House or simply reject the false electors. When Pence refused, that is when the Stop the Steal riot was instigated. The goal was to create as much confusion, chaos, and violence as possible and halt the certification of the electors, using said violence as a pretext for clinging to power. The last ditch effort being that Pence would have no choice but to succumb to the pressure and declare irregularities, such that the electoral votes could not be counted at all.\n\nFurthermore, there's no reason whatsoever to assume Trump didn't know he lost. \n\n* VP Mike Pence told Trump “he had seen no evidence of fraud\" that would change the outcome of the election. \n* Senior Justice Department leaders told Trump multiple times that there was no evidence that supported support his claims of election fraud. \n* The Director of National Intelligence told Trump the intelligence community did not find any evidence of interference that “would change the outcome of the election.”\n* The DHS told Trump “that there was no evidence any voting system had been comprised” and that \"the 2020 election was the most secure in American history.\" \n* Senior White House attorneys told Trump there was “no evidence” of election fraud.\n* Trump's senior campaign staff told Trump he only had a 5-10% chance of winning his re-election, and only if he won ongoing vote counts and litigation in Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin. \n* State legislators and officials who supported Trump repeatedly told him that his election fraud claims were “false.”\n* State and federal courts assessed all of his lawsuits alleging election fraud and ruled “his allegations were meritless.\"",

Just because Snopes got it right, we are to ignore the fact that the media purposefully lied about this repeatedly to mislead people and lable Trump as a racist or at least sympathetic to racists? The fact is that Trump condnemded racsist in his very next breath, but the media cut that part out. Sorry, but that really did happen. Also, Kamala event brought it up and lied about it again in the presidential debate. Sorry, you lost me just on the third entry. Like I said, maybe I am misunderstanding the point in the post. However, it appears you have cherry-pick sources that align with your worldview and then ignore everything else. I will be honest and say that I stopped reading anything beyond this.

The words, actions and timing of the administration and Harris both confirm it. \n\n\nWhen Biden put Harris in charge of the border in March 2021, he said she would be part of a “full team” that would “deal with the problem here at home” and “in terms of in-country.” He added that “it’s not her full responsibility and job, but she’s leading the effort.”\n\nSo Biden’s appointment of Harris as the administration’s point person on immigration was about as comprehensive as it could be. The problem was not in its vagueness, but Harris’s execution of her comprehensive responsibility.\"\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/thehill.com/opinion/immigration/4813704-kamala-harris-border-czar-denial/amp/\n\nAxios is one of many news organizations that called Harris the \"Border Czar.\" Biden put her as the leader for the immigration problem at home.",

It can change the 1's &amp; zero's instantly. It's extremely shocking, so know that it exists, but hold tight to the everlasting truth of God's word. God tells us not to fear the enemy or their powers. (Luke 10:19 &amp; Joshua1:9) God hears their thoughts, knows their plans, &amp; knows all things throughout time. God hears our thoughts &amp; concerns. He commands us not to fear, but to pray in complete faith, in Jesus' name. (John14:13) His Holy Spirit is inside of Christians. God knows everything, is almighty &amp; loves Christians as children. (Galatians 3:26 &amp; Romans 8:28) The satanic Illuminati might reveal the Antichrist soon. Be ready. Daily put on the full armor of God (Ephesians 6:10-18), study God's word, &amp; preach repentance &amp; the gospel of Jesus Christ. Pope Francis might be the False Prophet. (Revelation 13) Watch the video Pope Francis and His Lies: False Prophet exposed on YouTube. Also watch Are Catholics Saved on the Reformed Christian Teaching channel on YouTube.  Watch the Antichrist45 channel on YouTube or Rumble. The Man of Sin will demand worship and his image will talk to the world through AI and the flat screens. Revelation 13:15 \"And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.\"\nGuard your eyes, ears &amp; heart.

Thiel, who made his $21 billion fortune in venture capitalism, has described himself as a libertarian. But his political spending habits reveal his authoritarian ambitions.  In 2016, at a time when many elites dismissed Donald Trump’s chances of winning the White House, Thiel [donated](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/16/technology/peter-thiel-donald-j-trump.html) $1.25 million to Trump’s campaign and delivered a [speech](https://time.com/4417679/republican-convention-peter-thiel-transcript/) at the Republican National Convention lamenting the absence of big tech in government. By the 2022 midterms, Thiel’s influence had grown considerably. He poured over [$20 million](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/14/technology/republican-trump-peter-thiel.html) into the campaigns of far-right Republican candidates, many of whom amplified Trump’s lies about the 2020 election and laid the groundwork for the January 6 insurrection. One of Thiel’s most prominent beneficiaries was JD Vance, now the vice president, whose political rise was essentially [engineered](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/us/jd-vance-father-mentors.html) by Thiel.\n\n&gt;Mr. Vance met Peter Thiel, who co-founded PayPal and two other companies, when Mr. Thiel spoke at Yale in 2011. Mr. Vance has described Mr. Thiel’s talk about the negative impact of cutthroat competition among elites as the most significant moment of his Yale education. Luke Thompson, a political consultant and a close friend of Mr. Vance, described Mr. Thiel as Mr. Vance’s most important mentor, adding that the two men talk frequently. Mr. Vance has called Mr. Thiel an important sounding board.\n\n&gt;Mr. Thiel paved Mr. Vance’s way in the world of venture capitalism, and bankrolled Mr. Vance’s campaign for Ohio’s open Senate seat in 2022, which he won. He provided $15 million in financing, a large sum for an individual donor, and went with Mr. Vance to Mar-a-Lago to ask for Mr. Trump’s endorsement.\n\nWhile Thiel is perhaps best known as a founding member of the PayPal mafia, he deserves far more scrutiny as the founder and chairman of the shadowy tech giant Palantir Technologies. Despite branding itself as “[not a data company](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-is-not-a-data-company/),” Palantir builds powerful data surveillance tools that enable governments, law enforcement, and corporations to collect, integrate, and analyze vast amounts of personal data of citizens and customers. Well before the Trump administration, Palantir had embedded itself deep within the federal government, securing [contracts](https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/11/leaked-palantir-doc-reveals-uses-specific-functions-and-key-clients/) with the CIA, DHS, NSA, FBI, the CDC, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, Special Operations Command, West Point, the Joint IED-defeat organization and Allies, the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children by 2013. \n\nSince then, Palantir has secured its largest contracts from the U.S. Department of Defense, which has [spent](https://spacenews.com/pentagon-boosts-budget-for-palantirs-ai-software-in-major-expansion-of-project-maven/) more than a billion dollars to expand the company’s AI-driven targeting system known as the [Maven Smart System](https://defensescoop.com/2024/05/29/palantir-480-million-army-contract-maven-smart-system-artificial-intelligence/). \n\n&gt;“The MAVEN Smart System (MSS) by Palantir along with National Geospatial Agency (NGA) Broad Area Search – Targeting (BAS-T) uses AI generated algorithms and memory learning capabilities to scan and identify enemy systems in the Area of Responsibility (AOR). MAVEN fuses data from various Intelligence Surveillance &amp; Reconnaissance (ISR) systems to identify areas of interests,” according to the release.\n\nYet with minimal public oversight or transparency, it remains [unclear](https://blogs.icrc.org/law-and-policy/2024/09/04/the-risks-and-inefficacies-of-ai-systems-in-military-targeting-support/) how accurate these AI-driven systems truly are—or whether human analysts are consistently verifying the information before decisions are made. This raises serious concerns about the potential for error, misidentification, and accountability in automated warfare.\n\nFurther reading:\n\n* “‘The machine did it coldly’: Israel used AI to identify 37,000 Hamas targets,” [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/03/israel-gaza-ai-database-hamas-airstrikes)\n* “Palantir Supplying Israel With New Tools Since Hamas War Started,” [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-10/palantir-supplying-israel-with-new-tools-since-hamas-war-started)\n\n#Surveillance state\n\nIn March, Trump signed an [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/stopping-waste-fraud-and-abuse-by-eliminating-information-silos/) directing the federal government to share data across agencies, casting the “silos” that protect our information as barriers to eliminating “waste, fraud, and abuse.” We [now know](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/technology/trump-palantir-data-americans.html) that Palantir has secured contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars to build a centralized, government-wide, searchable “mega-database” containing sensitive information on virtually everyone in the country.\n\n&gt;Mr. Trump has not publicly talked about the effort since. But behind the scenes, officials have quietly put technological building blocks into place to enable his plan. In particular, they have turned to one company: Palantir, the data analysis and technology firm…The push has put a key Palantir product called Foundry into at least four federal agencies, including D.H.S. and the Health and Human Services Department. Widely adopting Foundry, which organizes and analyzes data, paves the way for Mr. Trump to easily merge information from different agencies, the government officials said.\n\nThe lucrative contracts were funneled to Palantir via Elon Musk’s DOGE agency as far back as April, when [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/palantir-doge-irs-mega-api-data/) reported that the company had begun building a “mega API” for accessing IRS records. According to [ProPublica](https://projects.propublica.org/elon-musk-doge-tracker/), at least four top DOGE staffers previously worked at Palantir, including the Senior Adviser to the Director of DOGE (whoever that may be now) and the new Chief Technology Officer at the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nAs Keep_Track [warned](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1k0hxys/trump_and_musk_are_building_an_aidriven/) earlier this year, the convergence of DOGE’s massive [data extraction](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/15/nx-s1-5355896/doge-nlrb-elon-musk-spacex-security) and Palantir’s powerful pattern-matching software could allow the Trump administration to systematically target dissenters and marginalized communities. Those seeking gender-affirming care or abortions in states where such services are banned could face surveillance or prosecution. So could protesters opposing ICE, or journalists who publish stories critical of the regime, or the average American who makes an insulting social media post about the president.\n\nEveryone from lawmakers to former employees are sounding the alarm:\n\n&gt;\"The ultimate concern is a panopticon of a single federal database with everything that the government knows about every single person in this country,\" [Cody Venzke, senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, told [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/doge-collecting-immigrant-data-surveil-track/).] \"What we are seeing is likely the first step in creating that centralized dossier on everyone in this country.\"\n\n&gt;“Data that is collected for one reason should not be repurposed for other uses,” [Linda Xia, a signee who was a Palantir engineer until last year, said in a [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/technology/trump-palantir-data-americans.html) interview.] “Combining all that data, even with the noblest of intentions, significantly increases the risk of misuse.”\n\n&gt;“The unprecedented possibility of a searchable, ‘mega-database’ of tax returns and other data that will potentially be shared with or accessed by other federal agencies is a surveillance nightmare that raises a host of legal concerns, not least that it will make it significantly easier for Donald Trump’s Administration to spy on and target his growing list of enemies and other Americans,” [Democratic members of Congress [wrote](https://www.finance.senate.gov/ranking-members-news/wyden-ocasio-cortez-demand-answers-from-palantir-about-plans-to-build-irs-mega-database-of-american-citizens) in a letter to Palantir CEO Karp.]\n\nWe don’t have to look far to see the real-world implications of such a wide-ranging central database of people. The roving bands of [masked thugs](https://www.foxla.com/video/1663436)—who we should refuse to call federal agents as long as they refuse to identify themselves—kidnapping brown people off the streets are powered by Palantir software. The company has [partnered](https://theintercept.com/2017/03/02/palantir-provides-the-engine-for-donald-trumps-deportation-machine/) with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) since 2014, when the Obama administration awarded the company a $41 million contract to build and maintain an intelligence system (called ICM) that tracks the personal and criminal records of both legal and undocumented immigrants.\n\n&gt;ICM funding documents analyzed by The Intercept make clear that the system is far from a passive administrator of ICE’s case flow. ICM allows ICE agents to access a vast “ecosystem” of data to facilitate immigration officials in both discovering targets and then creating and administering cases against them. The system provides its users access to intelligence platforms maintained by the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and an array of other federal and private law enforcement entities. It can provide ICE agents access to information on a subject’s schooling, family relationships, employment information, phone records, immigration history, foreign exchange program status, personal connections, biometric traits, criminal records, and home and work addresses.\n\nAccording to internal company messages seen by [404 Media](https://www.404media.co/leaked-palantirs-plan-to-help-ice-deport-people/), Trump’s mass deportation push has super-charged Palantir’s surveillance network as it takes the lead in identifying and locating immigrants for ICE to deport, with the ability to track people who overstay their visas. Another project involves software to “support the logistics of deportation,” which essentially translates to prison databases that overlay information on who is detained, where they are detained, and how to most efficiently transport detainees between facilities and ultimately out of the country. \n\nMeanwhile, lawmakers of both parties are [cashing in](https://www.quiverquant.com/congresstrading/stock/PLTR) on Palantir’s expanding panopticon. Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna (CA) has purchased tens of thousands of dollars of Palantir stock since Trump took office. So have Republican Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (GA) and Rob Brenahan (PA). \n\nAnd, to top it all off, Trump’s chief immigration policy advisor, Stephen Miller, [owns](https://www.pogo.org/investigations/stephen-miller-conflicts-of-interest) between $100,000 and $250,000 in Palantir stock. The man orchestrating the expansion of a surveillance state designed to violate people's civil and human rights is directly profiting from the machinery he’s helping to build.\n\n---\n\nThe creation of a centralized, AI-enhanced database of personal information is not a distant dystopia—it is already underway. As CEO Alex Karp recently [boasted](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/palantir-ceo-hails-musk-doge-132116257.html?guccounter=1) on a quarterly earnings call, “Palantir is here to disrupt and make the institutions we partner with the very best in the world and, when it’s necessary, to scare enemies and on occasion kill them.” When that partner is Donald Trump, and his enemies are law-abiding Americans who dare to dissent, Palantir becomes more than just a tech company. It becomes a threat to democracy itself.",

You are top of the list to lose your citizenship.\n\nUs not-evil-people cannot imagine the cruelty this administration could enact with such a tool.",

I guess the closest thing\nto a successful attempt to creating a libertarian utopia is when a bunch of libertarians\ndecided to move and try to take over some smaller town Grafton in New Hampshire\nas a [\"Free Town Project\"](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/21534416/free-state-project-new-hampshire-libertarians-matthew-hongoltz-hetling)\n(later changed to \"Free State Project\"), and ruined it with their reckless governance.\n\nLike for instance getting rid of public garbage collection.\nAnd with no mandatory garbage collection, of course they got problems\nwith wild bears walking around peoples' houses (in addition to some idiots deliberately\nfeeding wild bears, but hey in a libertarian society nobody should be\nable to force people to stop doing what they want...).\n\nThere is a book about it with title [\"A libertarian walks into a bear\"](https://www.allbookstores.com/search?type=advance&amp;author=&amp;title=A+Libertarian+Walks+Into+a+Bear&amp;isbn=&amp;binding=&amp;dateyear_operator=during&amp;dateyear=).\n\n-----\n\nJ.D. Vance is one of Peter's *ultra-right Thielists*. There is a video [Who is Peter Thiel?](https://youtu.be/SKY5pOcEn4U?t=616) (in German but with English subtitles available)\nfrom two years ago that goes into who Peter is and what he have done, and J.D. Vance is covered as part of that.\n\nAnother noteworthy mention is that [Some more news](https://www.youtube.com/@SMN) also included J.D. Vance in their video\n[Peter Thiel and his dorky little goons](https://youtu.be/4WfHXt1ZQhg?t=146) from one year ago.\nSome more news is truly amazing in both the depth and the volume they produce. Hats off for them.",

        "selftext": "Housekeeping:\n\n* HOW TO SUPPORT: I know we are all facing unprecedented financial hardships right now. If you are in the position to support my work, I have a [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/RusticGorilla), [venmo](https://venmo.com/code?user_id=2974196418215936837), and a [paypal](http://paypal.me/CobbAdrienne) set up. No pressure though, I will keep posting these pieces publicly no matter what - paywalls suck.\n\n* NOTIFICATIONS: You can [signup](http://eepurl.com/gKUtUH) to receive a (somewhat) monthly email with links to my posts.\n\n---\n---\n\nSix of the nine justices of the Supreme Court—the highest court in the United States, with the power to declare actions of the Legislative and Executive branch unconstitutional—were (or are) members of a powerful organization called the Federalist Society. The group is a collection of conservative and libertarian lawyers who are often chosen by Republican presidents to ascend to the federal bench. \n\nLeonard Leo, executive vice president of the Federalist Society, advised both George W. Bush and Donald Trump on the confirmation process for Supreme Court justices, leading to Roberts’ and Alito’s placement as well as the success of Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett. Clarence Thomas, too, is a member of the Federalist Society.\n\n---\n\nAs a non-profit, the Federalist Society is not required to report individual donations to the IRS. What we know of donors to the Federalist Society is what the organization itself chooses to publicize.\n\nI went through the group’s last three [annual reports](https://fedsoc.org/annual-report) (2017-2019, the most recent available) detailing their donors. Many choose to remain anonymous.\n\n*This list is not comprehensive; see the annual reports link above for the full lists.*\n\n##Large corporations:\n\n* Google: Gave at least $100,000 every year\n* Koch Industries: Gave at least $100,000 every year\n* Walmart: Gave at least $100,000 in 2017 and $50,000-$99,999 in 2018\n* Chevron Corporation: Gave $50,000-$99,999 every year\n* Facebook: Gave $50,000-$99,999 in 2018 and 2019, gave $25,000-$49,999 in 2017\n* Pfizer, Inc.: Gave $50,000-$99,999 every year\n* Microsoft: Gave $50,000-$99,999 in 2017 and 2018\n* GlaxoSmithKline: Gave $50,000-$99,999 in 2018 and $25,000-$49,999 in 2017.\n* T-Mobile: Gave $25,000-$49,999 in 2018 and 2019\n* Verizon: Gave $25,000-$49,999 every year\n* Exxon Mobil Corporation: Gave $10,000-$24,999 every year\n\n---\n\n##Foundations:\n\n**The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation**, gave at least $100,000 every year: top funder for groups affiliated with charter schools; Pro-Trump attorney Cleta Mitchell sits on the foundation's board of directors \n\n&gt;[New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/08/09/the-big-money-behind-the-big-lie): Based in Milwaukee, the private, tax-exempt organization has become an extraordinary force in persuading mainstream Republicans to support radical challenges to election rules—a tactic once relegated to the far right. With an endowment of some eight hundred and fifty million dollars, the foundation funds a network of groups that have been stoking fear about election fraud, in some cases for years. Public records show that, since 2012, the foundation has spent some eighteen million dollars supporting eleven conservative groups involved in election issues.\n\n**E.L. Craig Foundation**, gave at least $100,000 every year: Created by the founder of TAMKO Building Products; headed by his daughter, Ethelmae Humphreys, who served on the boards of the libertarian think tank Cato Institute; Humphreys and her children financially supported Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and donated $850,000 to Club for Growth Action Missouri to support Sen. Josh Hawley.\n\n**The Hugh and Hazel Darling Foundation**, gave at least $100,000 every year: A legal education foundation in California. UCLA Law School features a legal library in their name.\n\n**Donors Trust**, gave at least $100,000 every year: Donors Trust is one of the biggest conservative dark money groups. “[Now-deceased CEO Whitney] Ball [says](https://web.archive.org/web/20150724184044/http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/02/donors-trust-donor-capital-fund-dark-money-koch-bradley-devos) she travels all over the country courting wealthy conservatives and libertarians, and attends Koch donor retreats and Cato ‘shareholder’ meetings. The crux of her pitch is this: Rich folks can give to Donors Trust and rest easy knowing that their millions will continue bankrolling the conservative movement long into the future, even after their death.”\n\n**The William &amp; Flora Hewlett Foundation**, gave at least $100,000 every year: Created by Hewlett-Packard cofounder William Redington Hewlett. According to Influence Watch, the foundation gave $500,000 to the Federalist Society in “support of the Article 1 Initiative,” which is [dedicated](https://youtu.be/7ibJWS2SrUY) to “examining whether the contemporary Congress is operating according to the original constitutional design.”\n\n**Koret Foundation**, gave at least $100,000 every year: pro-Israel foundation headed by a director of Exxon Mobil\n\n**Lilly Endowment, Inc.**, gave at least $100,000 every year: Created by Eli Lilly and Company heirs. Supports numerous religious education organizations.\n\n**The Marcus Foundation, Inc.,** gave at least $100,000 every year: Created by Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus (who also supported Trump’s 2016 and 2020 campaigns).\n\n**Searle Freedom Trust**, gave at least $100,000 every year: Founded by Daniel C. Searle, of Searle &amp; Company (now part of Pfizer). The trust has given over $2 million to the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).\n\n**The Ed Uihlein Family Foundation**, gave at least $100,000 every year: Created by founder of Uline packaging and office supply firm. Gave  $4.3 million to a group involved in the pre-insurrection rally of Jan. 6.\n\n**U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation,** gave $50,000-$99,000 every year: A private nonprofit business league that traditionally donates to conservative candidates and committees.\n\n**Adolph Coors Foundation**, gave $50,000-$99,000 every year: Created by the son of the founder of the Coors Brewing Company. Seeks to educate Americans “in the wisdom of the free enterprise system, traditional Judeo-Christian values and the rule of law.”\n\n**The Snider Foundation**, gave $25,000-$49,999 in 2017 and 2018: Created by Ed Snider, former chairman of the company that owns the Philadelphia Flyers and former owner of the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\n---\n\n##Individuals\n\n**David and Charles Koch**, gave at least $100,000 every year \n\n**Scott &amp; Cyan Banister**, gave at least $100,000 every year: Tech investors involved in Paypal, Uber, and SpaceX; gave to Rand Paul for President and Ted Cruz for President\n\n**Mark Kolokotrones**, gave at least $100,000 every year: Founder of financial services firm Castle Knoll Investments LLC and trustee of the Heritage Foundation.\n\n**Raymond Ruddy and Marilyn Ruddy**, gave at least $100,000 in 2018 and 2019, gave $10,000-$24,999 in 2017: Catholic pro-life donors.\n\n**Rex Sinquefield** gave at least $100,000 in 2018 and 2019, gave $10,000-$24,999 in 2017: Investor with a [long history](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/king-rex-sinquefield-108015/) of supporting Republican candidates in Missouri.\n\n**Thomas W. Smith**, gave at least $100,000 every year: A hedge fund manager in Florida. Very little public information available.\n\n**Ted and Jennifer Ullyot**, gave at least $100,000 every year: Ted was an attorney in George W. Bush’s administration and served as Facebook's general counsel from September 2008 until July 2013. \n\n**Roger and Susan Hertog**, gave at least $100,000 every year: Roger manages the Tikvah Fund, which [opened](https://www.jewthink.org/2021/03/12/the-federalist-society-makes-aliyah/) a Federalist Society copycat group in Israel, “aimed at developing a new generation of conservative legal thinkers and judicial leaders for the Jewish state.”\n\n**Ken and Frayda Levy**, gave $50,000-$99,000 every year: Ken is a co-founder of Jacobs Levy Equity Management. He and his wife are heavily involved in pro-Israel organizations, [believing](https://njjewishnews.timesofisrael.com/we-believe-that-judaism-supports-the-free-markets/) that “Israel is not a free-market economy” and needs more Reaganomics.",

They're unable to dissect the messages they receive and instead parrot a narrative created for ratings. I think I'm constantly evaluating the media and messages I receive (including comments on reddit). I like pointing out bias or a common fallacy so I can spot a disingenuous argument pretty quickly. Some people are dissecting every word she (or anyone) says hoping they can pick up on some catch phrase they've inherently misunderstood. The media they consume has allowed them to think that they're actually offering a sound debate. In reality, it's embarrassing to have to argue with someone who is so clearly lacking critical thinking. It would be like feeling proud to win a debate against a kid but I admit I'll occasionally do it anyway.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone, \n\nI’m finding that people don’t seem to know the details about how the Kochs attacked climate science and I can’t post this in r/50501 anymore and my post in r/climate change got removed (I didn’t read the description so I think it was the wrong sub, my bad) so I’m posting here so you don’t have to read the 450+ pages - Dark Money is 10 years old but it explains exactly how we ended up here - if anyone has another detailed source that is more recent, please let me know. \n\nI will have to do two more posts but my first post in r/50501 is still there and linked above. \n\n———-\n\n# **Corporate lobbying [xvi] legal organizations, lobbyists** [xviii]\n\nBy 1990, enterprising conservative and libertarian activists were wearing a path to Wichita to pitch their proposals to Charles Koch in hopes of his patronage. [178] In 1991, William “Chip” Mellor, III, a former Reagan administration lawyer, proposed an aggressive, right-wing public interest law firm that would litigate against government regulations in favor of “economic liberty”. [178] \n\n&gt; Charles Koch said, “Here’s what I’m going to do. I’ll give you up to $500,000 a year for three years, each year, but you’ll have to come back each year and demonstrate that you’ve met these milestones that you’ve set out to accomplish and I will evaluate it on a yearly basis, and there’s no guarantees.” [178] The legal group, the **Institute for Justice**, went on to bring numerous successful cases against government regulations, including campaign-finance laws, several of which reached the Supreme Court. [178]\n\n## From 1998-2008, Koch Industries spent more than $50 million on lobbying. [1998-2008, 179]\n\nAnother member of the Koch network, Richard DeVos ($5.7 billion) [no date, 21], cofounder of Amway, Michigan-based MLM empire, led similar efforts to take political action and change laws after pleading guilty to defrauding the Canadian government (from 1965-1978 [285]) of $22 million in customs duties in 1982. [20]\n\nIn 1980, Richard DeVos and Jay Van Andel, cofounders of Amway, became the top spenders on behalf of Ronald Reagan’s presidential candidacy. [285] By 1981, Richard DeVos was the finance chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC), which Jay Van Andel headed the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. [285]\n\nAmway gave $2.5 million to the Republican Party during the 1994 midterm elections, which was the largest known soft money donation from a corporation in the country’s history. [287]\n\nRichard Junior, known as Dick, married the other royal family of Michigan’s Dutch Reformed community, Betsy Prince, whose father, Edgar Prince, founded an auto parts manufacturing company that sold for $1.35 billion in cash in 1996, while her brother, Erik Prince, founded the global security firm Blackwater, which reporter Jeremy Scahill described as “the world’s most powerful mercenary army”. [287]\nBetsy DeVos eventually became the chairwoman of Michigan’s Republican Party.\n\nThe DeVos family funded legal challenges to various campaign finance laws for years. In 1997, Betsy DeVos became a founding member of the James Madison Center for Free Speech, a nonprofit organization whose only goal was to end all restrictions on money in politics. [288] Its honorary chairman was Senator Mitch McConnell, a savvy and prodigious fundraiser. [288] By designating itself a nonprofit charitable group, the Madison Center enabled the DeVos Family Foundation and other supporters to take tax deductions for subsidizing long-shot lawsuits that might never have been attempted otherwise. [289]\n\n&gt; Betsy DeVos wrote, “My family is the largest single contributor of soft money [e.g. for “issue” ads] to the national Republican Party … We do expect some things in return”. [289]\n\n&gt; As a Republican running for office in Kentucky in the 1970s, McConnell admitted, “[A] spending edge is the only thing that gives a Republican a chance to compete”. [288] In a Senate debate on proposed campaign finance restrictions, McConnell repeatedly told colleagues, “If we stop this thing, we can control the institution for the next 20 years”. [288]\n\n# **Politically tinged nonprofit spending** [xvi] think tanks, academic programs, front groups [xviii] \n\n### Between 1998-2008, Charles Koch’s private fund, the **Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation**, made more than $48 million in tax-deductible grants, primarily to groups promoting his political views. [179] The Claude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation, controlled by Charles and his wife Liz, with two company executives and an accountant, similarly made more than $28 million in tax-deductible grants. [179] David Koch’s fund, the **David H. Koch Charitable Foundation**, made more than $120 million in tax-deductible grants - many to cultural and scientific projects rather than political. [179]\n**Academic programs - the “intellectual track within the DC-New York corridor” to influence elite opinion with op-ed pieces, lawsuits, and expert think tank studies** [235-236]\n\n&gt; Charles Koch wanted to focus on “attracting youth” because “this is the only group that is open to a radically different social philosophy” [68] through educational indoctrination, with free-market curricula and even video games promoting his ideology pitched to prospects as young as grade school. [68]\n\n&gt; He believed that government interference in the economy was what had caused the last Great Depression. [210] “Bankers, brokers and businessmen” had been falsely blamed. [210] The true culprits to him were Herbert Hoover and Franklin Roosevelt, whom he regarded as dangerous liberals. [210]\n\n&gt; “He advocated funding private institutes within prestigious universities, where influence over hiring decisions and other forms of control could be exerted by donors while hiding the radicalism of their aims. [69] “It would be necessary to use ambiguous and misleading names, obscure the true agenda, and conceal the means of control. This is the method that Charles Koch would soon practice in his charitable giving, and later in his political actions” [69]\n\n&gt; “In order to alter the direction of America, they realized they would have to “influence the areas where policy ideas percolate from: academia and think tanks”” [71] “Cumulatively, the many-tentacled ideological machine they built came to be known as the Kochtopus”. [71]\n\nBy 1981, the Kochs’ donations of $30 million largely funded the **Mercatus Center**, a think tank located on the George Mason University campus, a public university, advertised as “the world’s premier university source for market-oriented ideas - bridging the gap between academic ideas and real-world problems”. [182] \n\nClayton Coppin, who taught history at George Mason and compiled Charles’s political activities for Bill Koch, characterized the Mercatus Center as “a lobbying group disguised as a disinterested academic program” that enabled Charles to “have a tax deduction for financing a group, which for all practical purposes is a lobbying group for his corporate interest”. [183]\n\nIn the same building as the Mercatus Center was another heavily Koch-funded institute, chaired by Charles Koch, the Institute for Humane Studies. [183] Its founder had called taxes “theft”, welfare “immoral”, and opposed court-ordered remedies to racial segregation. [183] The aim of the IHS was to cultivate and subsidize the next generation’s libertarian scholars. [183] \n\n### &gt; Charles reportedly demanded better metrics with which to monitor students’ political views. [183] To the dismay of some faculty members, applicants’ essays had to be run through computers in order to count the number of times they mentioned the free-market icons Ayn Rand and Milton Friedman. [183] Students were tested at the beginning and the end of each week for ideological improvement. [183] The institute also housed the Charles G. Koch summer internship program, a paid fellowship placing students who shared the Kochs’ views in like-minded nonprofit groups, where they could join the libertarian network. [183]\n\nBy 2004, the Wall Street Journal dubbed the **Mercatus Center** as “the most important think tank you’ve never heard of” and noted that 14 of the 23 regulations that President George W. Bush placed on a “hit list” had been suggested by Mercatus scholars. [186]\n\n&gt; Thomas McGarrity, a law professor at the University of Texas who specialized in environmental issues, argued that “Koch has been constantly in trouble with the EPA and Mercatus has constantly hammered on the agency”. [187] \n\n&gt; One environmental lawyer who clashed repeatedly with the Mercatus Center dismissed it as a lobbying show dressed up as a nonprofit, calling it “a means of laundering economic aims”. [187] The lawyer explained the strategy: “You take the corporate money and give it to a neutral-sounding think tank,” which “hires people with pedigrees and academic degrees who put out credible-seeming studies. But they all coincide perfectly with the economic interests of their funders”. [187]\n\n&gt; For example, a top official at the Mercatus Center made a pro-smog argument that “by blocking the sun, smog cut down on cases of skin cancer. She claimed that if pollution were controlled, it would cause up to 11,000 additional cases of skin cancer”. [187]\nWendy Gramm, wife of Senator Phil Gramm, head of Mercatus’ Regulatory Studies Program, pushed for the Enron Loophole, exempting the type of energy derivatives from which Enron profited from regulatory oversight. [188] Senator Gramm crafted a deregulatory bill made to order for Enron and Koch, called the Commodity Futures Modernization Act. [188] In 2001, Enron collapsed in a heap of bogus financial statements and fraudulent accounting practices. [188] But Wendy Gramm had pocketed up to $1.8 million from Enron the year after arguing for the loophole. [188] It emerged that before going under, Enron had made substantial campaign contributions to Senator Gramm, while its chairman, Kenneth Lay, had given money to the Mercatus Center. [188]\n\nBy 2008, **George Mason University** was both the largest single recipient of Koch funds for higher education and the largest research university in Virginia [189]\n\n### In 1998, the American Petroleum Institute colluded with top oil executives and conservative think tank officials on a secret plan to spend $2 million to confuse the press and the public about the growing scientific consensus on global warming. [255] The plan called for recruiting skeptical scientists and training them in public relations so that they could act as spokesmen, thereby adding legitimacy and cover to the industry’s agenda. [255]\n\n### Kert Davies, the director of research at Greenpeace, the liberal environmental group, spent months trying to trace the funds flowing into a web of nonprofit organizations and talking heads, all denying the reality of global warming as if working from the same script. [251] What he discovered was that from 2005-2008, a single source, the Kochs, poured almost $25 million into dozens of different organizations fighting climate reforms. [251] His research showed that Charles and David had outspent, by a factor of three, what was then the world’s largest public oil company, ExxonMobil [251] In a 2010 report, Greenpeace crowned Koch Industries the “kingpin of climate science denial”. [251]\n\n### The first peer-reviewed academic study on climate science denial by Robert Brulle, Drexel professor of sociology and environmental science, discovered that between 2003-2010, more than half a billion ($558 million) dollars had been spent on a massive “campaign to manipulate and mislead the public about the threat posed by climate change”, funded by 140 conservative foundations - in essence, a corporate lobbying campaign disguised as a tax-exempt philanthropic endeavor. [251]\n\n### The money went to think tanks, advocacy groups, trade associations, other foundations, and academic and legal programs. [251]\n\n### However, 3/4 of the funds for this “climate change counter-movement” were untraceable. [252] Brulle said, “Powerful funders are supporting the campaign to deny scientific findings about global warming and raise public doubts about the roots and remedies of this massive global threat. At the very least, American voters deserve to know who is behind these efforts.” [252]\n\n### But by the time Obama took office, some had gone even more underground. Rather than funding directly, a growing number of conservative foundations and donors had begun directing their contributions through an organization called DonorsTrust. [253] Founded in 1999 by Whitney Ball, a West Virginia libertarian who had overseen development of the Koch-founded Cato Institute, it made contributions appear to go to a “donor-advised fund” rather than the more controversial groups she would later distribute the funds into. [253] This way, the donors’ names were erased from the money trail - meanwhile, the donors retained the same if not bigger charitable tax deductions. [253]\n\nA similar liberal donor-advised fund, the Tides Foundation, existed, but DonorsTrust as the conservative response soon had 4 times the funds and a far more strategic board. [253] Its directors consisted of the top officials of some of the most important organizations in the conservative movement, including the American Enterprise Institute, the Heritage Foundation and the Institute for Justice, the libertarian legal center whose start was funded by Charles Koch. [253]\n\nIn 2010, its single largest grant was $7.4 million to the Americans for Prosperity Foundation (AFP), chaired by David Koch. [253] This grant was 40% of the AFP’s funding that year, belying the notion that it was a genuine grassroots organization. [253]\n\n## Dr. James Baker, former head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said in 2005, “There’s a better scientific consensus on [global warming] than on any issues I know - except maybe Newton’s second law of thermodynamics”.

        "title": "Who is influencing Trump on Afrikaners?",
        "selftext": "The purpose of this post is to answer a question I have seen many users on this sub ask over the last few weeks: who is pushing all this Afrikaner stuff in the United States?\n\nThe answer is an Afrikaner lobbying and civil society group known in South Africa as [Afriforum](https://afriforum.co.za). Together with Afriforum is another organization known as [Solidarity](https://www.solidariteit.co.za), which is an Afrikaner trade union. Afriforum and Solidarity are not political parties, but are well-resourced and effective parts of the civil society advocating for the interests of Afrikaners. Together they both fall under the umbrella of the '[Solidarity Movement](https://solidaritymovement.co.za)'.\n\nThe rest of this article explores the history of these organizations, their growing prominence in South Africa in recent years, their ideology and their beliefs.\n\n# Apartheid-era White Politics\n\nTo understand where these organizations come from, you have to start in the 80s.\n\nDuring Apartheid, the party that governed under the White only elections was called the [National Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Party_(South_Africa)) ('the Nats'). These are the people who designed and enforced Apartheid.\n\nThere were other parties that stood in opposition to the Nats. An early example were the United party of Jan Smuts. But towards the end of Apartheid, reformists from the United Party and other liberal parties coalesced into a liberal party known as the [Progressive Federal Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Federal_Party) ('the Progs'). These are White people who opposed Apartheid but participated in Parliamentary politics, like [Helen Suzman](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/06/helen-suzman-mandela-forgotten-saint-anti-apartheid).\n\nIn the 80s, the Nats began a process of trying to reform Apartheid by introducing some basic representation for Indian and Coloured people (but not Black people). They wanted to have a '[Tricameral Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricameral_Parliament)' where [Indians ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_South_Africans)and [Coloureds ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coloureds)would be able to have their own representatives. When the talk of reforms began, a group in the National Party broke away in resistance to these reforms. They formed [**the Conservative Party**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(South_Africa)).\n\nThe Conservative Party quickly overtook the Progs as the official opposition. During the 1992 referendum to end Apartheid, they campaigned for No which won 30% of the vote (White South Africans), which is about the same as their level of support in Parliament.\n\nThe Conservative Party represented White people to the right-wing of the National Party of Both and De Klerk. The opposed the end of Apartheid. They were far-right Afrikaner Nationalists.\n\nDuring the negotiations to end Apartheid, members of the Conservative Party were [involved in the assassination the leader of South Africa's Communist Party](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/36866.stm), Chris Hani.\n\nThere were people even further to the right of the Conservative Party, like the Afrikaner Weerstandbeweging (AWB). These right-wing terrorists were [literally neo-Nazis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaner_Weerstandsbeweging) who formed militias to terrorize negotiators and ordinary citizens.\n\nSo there was an entire political spectrum to the right of the National Party, that ran from the Conservative Party to neo-Nazis like the AWB. Many of these forces coalesced into militias united under the Afrikaner Volksfront, led by Constand Viljoen, a former military general.\n\nThe Volksfront attempted to assist the dictator of the Tswana Bantustan, Lucas Mangope, to maintain his rule in the face of pro-democracy/pro-ANC protests. The AWB (neo-Nazis) got involved against Mangope's wishes. Mangope wanted Viljoen and the more 'moderate' militia elements, often led by former army generals. Many senior leaders in the Volksfront were also wary of the AWB. The situation escalated dramatically and the [entire plan failed spectacularly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Bophuthatswana_crisis#Attempted_takeover). \n\nViljoen then left the Volksfront and formed a political party which participated in the transition to democracy and the first elections. The party that Viljoen formed was called the Freedom Front. \n\nThe Freedom Front would eventually absorb those Afrikaner right-wing leaders who didn't want to run around with AWB neo-nazi militias, but who nonetheless were to the right of the National Party. Many of the leaders and members of the Conservative Party would [end up in the Freedom Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Mulder).\n\nThe Freedom Front was thus the successor to the Conservative Party. It was founded by right-wing Afrikaners, from Parliamentarians to former defense officials acting as militia leaders during the tumultuous transition to democracy. But it stopped short of going into the territory of the militant neo-Nazis like the AWB. \n\nUnlike the Conservative Party, the Freedom Front participated in the 1994 elections and ran on the idea of creating an Afrikaner ethnic enclave within South Africa, known as a *Volkstaat.* Charitably, this would be something like Afrikaner Quebec. Less charitably, it was an attempt to create a White Afrikaner ethnostate within the borders of South Africa, and any talk of co-existence was a pretext to declaring independence from South Africa and establishing an Afrikaner Republic. \n\nIn the final years of Apartheid and the first years of democracy, White South African politics thus went like this:\n\n* Liberals who opposed Apartheid voted for the Progressive Freedom Party, which rebranded as the Democratic Party.\n* Conservatives who supported Apartheid and opposed reforms and its end voted for the Conservative Party which evolved into the Freedom Front.\n* Most White South Africans voted for the National Party led by FW de Klerk. This was the party the implemented Apartheid, but also, ultimately, negotiated its end. By the standards of Apartheid-era White South Africa, it was the 'center'.\n* The far-far-right nutjobs were involved in militias and neo-Nazi type groups which were quickly brought under control.\n* Genuine left-wing Whites voted for the ANC.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the National Party collapsed. Its leaders would scatter amongst many parties (including the ANC), but its membership moved almost entirely into the Democratic Party, which became the Democratic Alliance we know today.\n\nThe Freedom Front Plus picked up a few other microparties and rebranded as the [Freedom Front Plus (FF+)](https://theconversation.com/the-who-why-and-what-of-south-africas-minority-afrikaner-party-116913). Just as the National Party and Democratic Alliance included many Coloured voters, the Freedom Front Plus was also able to pick up a few prominent Coloured political leaders. They presented themselves as a party not merely for Afrikaners, but for 'minorities' in general. In practise, they would maintain a keen focus on Afrikaners in particular, with a link to the Coloured community through the Afrikaans language, of which Coloureds comprise the majority of speakers.\n\n# Afriforum and Solidarity\n\nThe Afrikaner Nationalists were unsuccessful in negotiating a Volkstaat for themselves. When the National Party collapsed in the early 2000s, most of those voters ended up in the DA rather than the FF+. The transition to democracy had gone well, and the economy was growing. Mandela's project was successful, and the ANC commanded supermajorities in Parliament which they exercised mostly responsibly. The appetite for Volkstaat 80s/90s panic was thus quite low, and Afrikaners began to lose interest in even moderate forms of these ideas. Politically, the Freedom Front Plus was very weak, even just within White and Coloured communities.\n\nThese conditions meant that the Afrikaner Nationalists had to modernize in order to maintain their relevance. In 2006, Afriforum was founded. Here is how it is described on its website:\n\n&gt;AfriForum is a non-profit civil rights organisation that was established on 26 March 2006. The organisation was created to call up Afrikaners to participate in public debate and actions outside of the sphere of party politics\n\nAfriforum worked together with a White trade union, Solidarity, to form the broader Solidarity Movement to mobilize Afrikaners outside of party politics. One of the founders of Afriforum, Kallie Kriel, is a [former member of the Conservative Party](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/9-things-you-most-likely-didnt-know-about-afriforum_uk_5c7e96cde4b078abc6c1199f) and [the Freedom Front Plus](https://theconversation.com/south-africas-white-right-the-alt-right-and-the-alternative-103544). It is that same political tradition brought into a much more modern form.\n\nAfriforum is a very effective organization. It is not just a think tank, like the Heritage Foundation. Afriforum, together with the broader Solidarity movement, are active in undertaking practical projects and litigation to fix problems in failing communities. Here are some examples:\n\n* They have established a network of community policing forums. These are [neighbourhood and farm watch groups](https://www.biznews.com/sa-investing/2022/07/13/afriforum-state-proof-communities#:~:text=organisation%20has%20155%20neighbourhood%20and,continued%20failure%20of%20the%20government) staffed by thousands of volunteers and working [in coordination with the South African Police Service](https://www.politicsweb.co.za/politics/afriforum-and-saps-join-forces-to-combat-crime).\n* They fixed [potholes](https://www.citizen.co.za/rekord/news-headlines/2020/08/04/afriforum-volunteers-tackle-centurion-pothole/#:~:text=ImageAFriForum’s%20volunteers%20busy%20fixing%20the,Photo%3A%20Facebook) in the City of Pretoria and other municipalities, and organizing volunteers to assist local municipalities with basic services like [grass-cutting](https://www.iol.co.za/pretoria-news/news/city-join-hands-with-afriforum-to-render-services-a892eae4-da5d-4cda-bbc5-b53267f89e84).\n* They have taken the government to court to interdict decisions that they view as reckless or irresponsible, for example [donating money to Cuba](https://mg.co.za/news/2022-03-23-court-rules-in-favour-of-afriforum-to-halt-r50m-donation-to-cuba/) or [increasing electricity tariffs](https://www.news24.com/fin24/economy/afriforum-moves-to-bar-july-municipal-electricity-hikes-on-concerns-they-fall-short-of-law-20240609).\n* They have also taken educational institutions [to court](https://www.iol.co.za/pretoria-news/news/mixed-reaction-to-judgment-reinstating-afrikaans-as-learning-teaching-medium-at-unisa-0dcea307-ff9a-4172-953b-b23067dbad9a#:~:text=The%20apex%20court%2C%20in%20its,erroneous%20and%20inconsistent%20with%20history) when they choose to phase out Afrikaans-medium instruction in favour of an English-only model.\n* They[ built an Afrikaans-medium private technical college](https://www.citizen.co.za/news/south-africa/education/sol-tech-college-june-2023/) from scratch in the city of Centurion, near Pretoria, on time and under budget to fight against the growing tide of English-medium only education, and they are currently planning to build a [university](https://businesstech.co.za/news/lifestyle/785241/new-r3-billion-private-university-for-south-africa/).\n* Establishing a [private prosecutions unit](https://theconversation.com/explainer-how-south-africas-first-private-prosecutions-unit-will-work-72389) (I believe it is the first in the country) to take on cases that the state prosecutors wrongly ignore. The Afriforum Private Prosecutions unit is headed up by Gerrie Nel, the renowned prosecutor who put Oscar Pistorious behind bars.\n* They established a large media network called [Maroela Media](https://maroelamedia.co.za) which is one of the largest Afrikaans-language media organizations in the country.\n\nThis competence has built Afriforum some credibility amongst Afrikaners and the broader society.\n\nThey couple this with a communication network led by effective, younger communicators on digital platforms. For example, their head of Public Relations, Ernst van Zyl, has a YouTube channel under the name [the Conscious Caracal](https://www.youtube.com/@ConsciousCaracal) and publishes at [the Daily Friend](https://dailyfriend.co.za).\n\nSo the idea here is that Afriforum is not a political party. It's not about getting votes and cushy jobs and prestige. They are practical people just trying to build a better world. And they aren't just complaining. They're rolling up their sleeves and actually doing something. If you are even slightly right of center, then Afriforum's politics is the kind of politics that you probably find legitimate and respectable. Within the logic of right-wing politics - even moderate right-wing politics - Afriforum has earned the right to talk about concepts like self-determination through their competence and their exercise of [self-reliance](https://www.biznews.com/rational-perspective/2023/10/20/helpmekaar-movement-afrikaners-self-empowerment-ernst-van-zyl) and responsibility.\n\nAfriforum have taken off in Afrikaner communities. Their membership exceeds that which you might expect if it were one-to-one with Freedom Front Plus voters. It is their competent, practical projects and their non-partisan engagement that allows them to quietly build an authentic relationship within communities. It is also obvious that their political influence doesn't stop at the Freedom Front Plus but extends deep into the Democratic Alliance as a result of Afriforum's influence amongst the base.\n\nThese are the people that traveled to the US and begun to bring up Afrikaner issues as a salient topic in Trump world. And before we get to criticizing them, it is crucial to understand how they present positively: as practical, 'roll-up-your-sleeves' types who are smart, hard working and brave. Even if you are only slightly right of center, Afriforum, or at least the version of themselves they present, are impressive and seem legit.\n\n# Lobbying in the West\n\nAfriforum began a campaign of lobbying in the United States and the West in May 2018. Afriforum sent their CEO, Kallie Kriel, and Deputy CEO, Dr. Ersnt Roets, to the United States. According to [Tyler McBrien of the Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/blog/us-and-foreign-governments-should-be-skeptical-afriforums-lobbying):\n\n* They visited the CATO Institute, where they left one analyst convinced that the \"explicitly racist\" policies of the ANC government mirrored those under Apartheid\n* They persuaded Australia's home affairs minister to call for visas to be issued for farmers\n* Were featured on Tucker Carlson regarding farm murders\n\nThey also met [the Heritage Foundation](https://x.com/ErnstRoets/status/993591741231124486), [Ted Cruz and John Bolton](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/14/trump-musk-south-africa-afriforum).\n\nLater that year, President Donald Trump issued his first tweet about South Africa:\n\n&gt;I have asked Secretary of State [u/SecPompeo](https://twitter.com/SecPompeo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1032454567152246785%7Ctwgr%5E8f584b29218701fa76116c8906417c304d3bc8cf%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.news24.com%2Fnews24%2Four-lobbying-has-certainly-had-an-impact-afriforum-on-trumps-land-expropriation-comments-20180823) to closely study the South Africa land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers. “South African Government is now seizing land from white farmers.” [@TuckerCarlson](https://twitter.com/TuckerCarlson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1032454567152246785%7Ctwgr%5E8f584b29218701fa76116c8906417c304d3bc8cf%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.news24.com%2Fnews24%2Four-lobbying-has-certainly-had-an-impact-afriforum-on-trumps-land-expropriation-comments-20180823) [@FoxNews](https://twitter.com/FoxNews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1032454567152246785%7Ctwgr%5E8f584b29218701fa76116c8906417c304d3bc8cf%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.news24.com%2Fnews24%2Four-lobbying-has-certainly-had-an-impact-afriforum-on-trumps-land-expropriation-comments-20180823)\n\nHe cited Tucker Carlson in the tweet and Afriforum [took credit for it](https://www.news24.com/news24/our-lobbying-has-certainly-had-an-impact-afriforum-on-trumps-land-expropriation-comments-20180823):\n\n&gt;\"We welcome it,\" said Ernst Roets. The group travelled to the US in May to lobby individual members of the US Senate and the House of Representatives. \"I think our lobbying has certainly had an impact because we have spoken with a lot of people who have had contact with President Trump and we have spoken with many think tanks, one of them for example the Cato Institute, which has taken a very strong stance shortly before this statement now by President Trump.\"\n\nThis is how we know that it is Afriforum that is in Trump's ear, indirectly. Trump's interest in this issue predates Elon's involvement in the administration by years. I'm not saying Elon isn't contributing anything today. But the Afriforum-Carlson-Trump pipeline was clear from as early as 2018.\n\nAfriforum's lobbying wasn't limited to the United States. They also travelled to Australia. After their lobbying there, the Australian Home Affairs minister indicated that he wanted to look at providing some sort of [refugee intake for Afrikaners](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/peter-dutton-wants-a-refugee-intake-of-white-south-african-farmers-20180315-p4z4gr.html):\n\n&gt;\"I've asked the department to look at ways that we can provide some assistance. We could provide more visas for people potentially in the humanitarian program,\" Mr Dutton told 2GB radio on Thursday.\n\n&gt;\"If people are being persecuted, regardless of whether it's because of religion or the colour of their skin or whatever, we need to provide assistance where we can.\"\n\n&gt;Mr Dutton said there were already large numbers of South African expatriates living in Australia.\n\n&gt;\"They work hard, they integrate well into Australian society, they contribute to make us a better country and they're the sorts of migrants that we want to bring into our country,\" he said.\n\n&gt;On Wednesday, Mr Dutton told News Corp white South African farmers \"deserve special attention\" and \"need help from a civilised country like ours\", and the Home Affairs department was working with partners in the region, with an announcement likely to be forthcoming soon.\n\nIn 2024, Afriforum returned to the United States. Their leaders attended the National Conservative Conference ([NATCON4](https://solidaritymovement.co.za/afrikaner-foundation-afriforum-raise-support-in-usa/)). Dr. Roets gave a presentation about the [The Afrikaner Philosophy of Fixing Your Own Problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtGCOAxdakE). It's actually a really nice speech rhetorically, and again it speaks to that spirit of 'do it for yourself' which Afriforum can genuinely lay some claim to. Roets is quite smart and well read. He is educated in law and his arguments have depth and logic to them.\n\nHe and other voices in this world have a very clever and fascinating proposition which they like to put forward to Westerners: that Zimbabwe's past is South Africa's ongoing present is the future of the West. Roets didn't use the word DEI in this speech (from late 2024), but that's the key idea here: that a powerful + DEI will lead to other people coming in and using that state against you, and you are better off doing things at a small-scale, self-reliant community level. The history and experiences of the Afrikaners become a case study in the effects of progressive politics. I strongly encourage you to watch or listen to the speech.\n\nUnfortunately, Roets often makes misleading claims and, more frequently, misleads audiences through omission. Westerners generally don't have enough of a background in the minutiae of South African history to poke holes in some of the arguments he makes. For example, in the speech he delivered at NATCON4, he contrasts the early 20th century Afrikaners who believed in self-help with those of the second half of the 20th century who believed in Big Government. He omits that it was the early 20th century Afrikaners who undertook a massive mineworkers strike and advocated for the government to maintain a [Colour Bar that would prevent willing and able Black people from undertaking skilled work in the mines](https://www.apartheidmuseum.org/uploads/files/Resources/learners-Book/Learners-book-Chapter2.pdf). \n\n# Mask Off\n\nBy all accounts, Afriforum's lobbying in the U.S. has been very successful. Donald Trump issued an executive order prioritising refugee settlement for Afrikaners as a direct consequence of their lobbying, and U.S. Congressmen have double down on this. \n\nBut, believe it or not, Afriforum isn't really happy with this. Because they don't want refugee status to escape South Africa, what they want is what the Afrikaner Nationalists have wanted since the transition to democracy - an ethnostate/enclave. There are many different and innovative ways to spin it, but that's basically the goal here. That is the reason why these organizations did not declare victory when Trump offered them refugee status, but instead submitted a memorandum [requesting](https://afriforum.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Washington-memorandum-25-Feb-2025-3.pdf) that\n\n&gt;Aid be provided to an Afrikaner development fund to assist with community infrastructure protecting Afrikaners. This includes safety structures, social structures, job structures, training structures and infrastructure to settle Afrikaners in a concentrated manner\n\nIt's the Volkstaat again, folks.\n\nIn addition to having a questionable end goal, every now and then, representatives from these movements will go mask off and draw immense criticism as a result. Even if you limit yourself to criticism only from centrist and right wing White people, you are left with:\n\n* Frans Cronje of the IRR think tank accusing them of releasing a documentary that attempted to [sanitize Apartheid and telling them to apologize](https://www.news24.com/News24/verwoerd-documentary-must-retracted-urges-irr-afriforum-says-neewat-20190313)\n* Gareth van Onselen, a prominent and fairly harsh liberal commentator, calling the same documentary [disgraceful](https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/opinion/columnists/2019-03-13-gareth-van-onselen-afriforums-disgraceful-and-immoral-documentary/) for its portrayal of Hendrik Verwoerd, the architect of Apartheid\n* Various academics circulating a letter of condemnation after Roets, in response to being fact-checked by an academic, quoted a Jewish writer Victor Klemperer, who wrote that if the tables were turned after the Holocaust he \"[would have all the intellectuals strung up](https://web.archive.org/web/20210308203417/https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2018/05/06/afriforum-heavyweight-launches-attack-on-academic-over-criticism-about-us-tour_a_23428355/?ncid=other_saredirect_m2afnz7mbfm), and the professors three feet higher than the rest; they would be left hanging from the lamp posts for as long as was compatible with hygiene.\"\n* Broad condemnation for Kallie Kriel, Afriforum's leader, for saying that [Apartheid was not a crime against humanity](https://mg.co.za/article/2018-05-14-i-dont-think-apartheid-was-a-crime-against-humanity-afriforums-kallie-kriel/) but it was wrong.\n* Constitutional Court Justice Edwin Cameron who raged in a judgment about Afriforum describing Apartheid as a '[so-called historical injustice](https://www.news24.com/News24/afriforum-hijacking-the-afrikaner-mainstream-20160726)'\n* [White MPs](https://www.news24.com/news24/racist-kids-from-pretoria-afriforum-slammed-for-tirade-about-land-20180906) from the ANC, DA and ACDP for their presentation on land expropriation. The ANC MP, who formerly was a member of the National Party, equated them to one of the most extreme Black Radical groups in South Africa, BLF. The DA MP said she found that she could not align with them at all. And the ACDP MP said that Afriforum were taking us backwards. [Video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsRipnvxkqQ).\n* Max du Preez describing Afriforum's youth wing as \"[stormtroopers](https://www.news24.com/News24/afriforum-hijacking-the-afrikaner-mainstream-20160726)\" and compared the mentality of Afriforum's supporters [to the EFF](https://web.archive.org/web/20190707134613/https://www.news24.com/Columnists/MaxduPreez/the-problem-afriforum-is-causing-the-da-20180515) on the other side of the aisle. I am not an Afrikaner and am not in all the Whatsapp groups and I don't go to community events. But du Preez says that in many circles pro-Afriforum are vicious and rabid in their defense of the organization, and they behave as cruel bullies.\n\nTwo things can be true at once. It is true that Afriforum are effective, capable and intelligent people who have built one of South Africa's most impactful NGOs/civil society organizations. It is also true that, the minute you scratch just a little bit deeper, you find Apartheid apologia, racism, authoritarianism, bullying and Christian nationalism.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWe know who is influencing the Republican Party on Afrikaners - it's Afriforum and their sister organizations collectively known as the Solidarity Movement. These organizations ultimately trace their heritage back to the Conservative Party - the party formed to resist even the modest 'reforms' to Apartheid in the 80s. \n\nThese organizations are full of persuasive, competent and intelligent people. They are also built on horrible historical foundations, starting from the mission to preserve the Apartheid system even after the National Party had begun to give up on it. The content that they put out, and the conduct of their members, has led to some prominent and respected voices in White South African politics labelling these organizations as racist hateful bullies when they feel they have an opportunity to do so without being punished by their peers or through litigation.\n\nThese organizations have successfully modernized Afrikaner Nationalism for the digital, 21st century era. They have managed to sync up with right wing movements and media ecosystems across the Western world, and to portray a story of Afrikaner history which resonates deeply with the agenda and worldview of the global Western right - from America to Germany to Australia. The story that Afriforum tell about themselves is misleading, and the stories they tell about South Africa are effectively Apartheid denialism. But these stories are growing in reach as the West continues to embrace ethnonationalist right wing ideas.\n\nThe success of the Solidarity Movement have prompted other right wing White voices to also journey to the US. [The Cape Independence Advocacy Group](https://www.primediaplus.com/2025/03/20/cape-independence-advocacy-group-to-lobby-us-for-western-cape-secession) has announced they will be going to the US, as have representatives from the Afrikaner-enclave town known as [Orania](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/south-africas-white-afrikaner-separatists-want-trumps-help-become-state-2025-04-03/). The Solidarity Movement itself have announced plans to go to Europe in 2025 to undertake [more lobbying](https://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/solidarity-movement-goes-to-europe-to-pressure-sa-government-over-expropriation-act-b65803ca-9b16-4162-8797-4d302a6e298e) there.",

This organization happened to align with their interests, especially since it takes place in South Africa which most Americans couldn't tell you anything about, thus allowing them to paint a pretty picture of white people being subjugated by a tyrannical majority black government. This then gradually flows upstream until it reaches the ears of Trump, who is either personally racist or knows that his voters are, and is therefore incentivized to champion this cause.

These days they talk about designating certain parts of the country to fall under specific community councils and devolving a lot of government power down to those councils, with protections for local / relative minorities. That plus Cape Independence, which gets you some nice urban areas and a big city.\n\nFrom the FF Plus 2024 Manifesto section on Self Determination:\n\n&gt; The FF Plus sees diversity as an asset for South Africa. So, diversity ought to be recognised and cherished on all levels of government. This includes respect for all communities’ languages, symbols, historical names and heritage.\n\n&gt; We urgently need a new political dispensation that truly recognises South Africa’s diversity; such recognition is a vital building block for achieving true unity in diversity. A dispensation built on mutual respect, without discrimination and racism, with access to equal opportunities, which recognises everyone’s individual as well as shared identity. Thus, a system whereby the correct forms of self-determination are implemented. Sections 235, 30, 31 and 185 of the Constitution and the Self-Determination Agreement are key, and the FF Plus is fully committed to it.\n\n&gt; This approach is a modern and practical political approach. Federalism, the devolution of power, subsidiarity, affording geographical building blocks more power, autonomy for areas and provinces, greater freedom for the Cape, a do-it-yourself approach, and a smaller government are all possible alternatives and crucial building blocks for such a political model.\n\n&gt; It is important to note that none of these possibilities is the only exclusive solution. This is not a situation where either this or that can be the only solution. Due to our diversity and the different circumstances in the various parts of South Africa, we find ourselves in a situation that requires this and that solution as well as a further variation of solutions.\n\n&gt; That is why the FF Plus supports the various initiatives promoting these solutions, including CapeXit. It is important that registered voters in the Western Cape are afforded the opportunity to express their views on the path of self-determination that they wish to take to greater independence and decision-making about their future, which could ultimately lead to autonomy and possible independence.\n\n&gt; The FF Plus, furthermore, endeavours to secure autonomy for a cultural community across the country, particularly concerning matters such as education, elderly care, sport, heritage conservation and the like.\n\n&gt; Community councils, such as an Afrikaner Council, should be established for communities that are spread out across the country.\n\n&gt; Such a council must have control of the relevant community’s education, heritage conservation and social care. Worldwide, these are considered the most basic ways in which national minorities can exercise self-determination.\n\n&gt; In practice, it would mean that the governing bodies of all schools, social institutions (for example, old-age homes and children’s homes) and heritage institutions (for example, museums and heritage sites) can decide whether or not they want to fall under the authority of the government or the community council.\n\n&gt; This is not racial segregation. A traditional Afrikaner school may not be interested in falling under the administration of the Afrikaner Council, but a coloured school might. Everyone has the right to choose.\n\n&gt; Such a council will enable Afrikaners to exercise their cultural rights regardless of where they reside.\n\n&gt; In this way, a republican government can be established over time in the face of the current tyranny of the majority.\n\n&gt; A legal framework should be devised for purpose-founded communities. Community property associations could meet that need, however, it is limited by the legislation regulating it to communities that receive land through land reform. In practice, this means only black and certain coloured communities.\n\nhttps://www.vfplus.org.za/policy/ff-plus-manifesto-2024/",

It isn't as simplistic as some people make it seem. White people have low unemployment rates and are doing well economically. But there can be instances of overcompliance, and frankly instances where even appropriate compliance might make you feel uncomfortable if you don't buy into the logic of affirmative action.\n- There are individuals who express hateful rhetoric around Afrikaners and Whites, including a few members of Parliament. They do usually get found guilty of hate speech, but the powerful ones have only ever received a slap on the wrist. It can feel like there is a double standard on hate speech and racism. And frankly at times there is.\n- The threat to farmland is not that serious based on the legislation as is. No Zimbabwe style land grabs coming down the pipeline. But there are some people who wish they could do that. But they will be the first ones to tell you that the current legal framework doesn't allow that.\n\nAll supposed discrimination against Whites would exte d to Anglos as well. It has been extremely bizarre and weird to hear Afrikaner Nationalist almost \"appropriate\" the grievances of the White population. Whether you agree with those grievances or not, it is very clearly a \"White\" issue. But they took the White issues and ran with them as if it is targeted at them. They go out of their way in published documents and in Trump's executive order to emphasize Afrikaners as an \"ethnic minority\", which they are not. They are a part of a racial minority. Honestly the way they play with race and ethnic identity is so shady.\n\nThe US under Trump should stay out of our business entirely. When Dems are back in charge, they can and should expose any shady business dealings we have with Russia and Iran. Our flirtations with those regimes is a moral shame. Merely exposing dodgy dealings when there is evidence will be enough.",

I, however… dream of waking up to this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u9qmarfg2dp21.png?width=2316&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bda736774e4d52acef8a0e80cc62750278c44370\n\n**Incoming Transmission\\***\n\nWith the overwhelming success of Geonosis, we are proud to announce our next two maps coming to Battlefront II: Mygeeto and Cato Neimoidia, inspired by their appearances in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tdrd4ypn2dp21.png?width=2316&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a27a784a42805c35e28d7ac4f8eb3516da9e60d2\n\nMygeeto will be added to Battlefront II this July and will be playable in Galactic assault, Capital Supremacy, Extraction, strike, and Blast. It will feature two new playable vehicles, a new artillery unit, and four new default-planet skins: the 21st Nova Corps. Although you probably know them by their more common name, the Galactic Marines.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yd8n4v4t2dp21.png?width=2244&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49df3ed7f5bf2e3289974f0c362a6d1f5267843b\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uy10dpiw2dp21.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75922954fda91dd578cec4234879d13b3dac179a\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-MHelPqkag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-MHelPqkag)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a4drdwiy2dp21.png?width=325&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd836a6502aa9482da65932561e53aa68868d35d\n\n***MAGNA TRI-DROIDS***\n\nThe first phase focuses on fast paced, close quarters combat as the Clones escort their UT-AT through the city ruins while the Droids attempt to destroy it with rocket launchers. Rubble plays a key part in gameplay as in some cases it is your only cover from enemy fire.\n\nAs the UT-AT gets closer to the main building, the Clones will have to cross a bridge riddled with potholes and covered in debris. Although the bridge is completely exposed, the environment evolves as the battle progresses making the trip across the bridge much safer for the Clones.\n\nMore information on that later in the Transmission.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c54wbee03dp21.png?width=338&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=816a5979888907a2672779ee80f441e41229cb1c\n\n***THE MAIN BUILDING***\n\nThe UT-AT has reached the main building and destroyed both of the Magna tri-droids guarding the entrance. The Clones must now slice through the door’s security systems in order to gain entry. While they are doing this, the Droids will attack them from both flanks. The destroyed pieces of the Magna tri-droids are the Clones major sources of cover, although there is a network of tunnels below the city streets that can be used by the Droids and Clones to travel from opposing sides of the battlefield.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/umvbur533dp21.png?width=382&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1ffbdbeb23b071621b409f5dde2adf3803bb845\n\n***DROID POWER GENERATOR***\n\nNow inside the lobby of the main building the Clones must destroy the Droid’s main power generator to help thin out their numbers, thus making it easier for the Clones to take the building. This objective must be fired upon until it is destroyed. However, due to the multi-floor layout of the lobby Droid snipers will be a significant threat.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6665heb43dp21.png?width=359&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e516ebdb1de2b2c195d4dd9a51ee8d1f15a991b0\n\n***THE ELEVATOR***\n\nWith the Droid numbers falling rapidly, the Clones will now attempt to take the main elevator at the back of the building. In order to accomplish this, the Clones must slice through the elevator controls in the security room at the back, left of the building, and capture the elevator room before their reinforcements run out.\n\nThat’s not all, though. Two new fully player controlled vehicles, and one artillery unit will be added when Mygeeto launches.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5mp28heb3dp21.png?width=2493&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c85f1942039ab13a3471ab3bedbcdad03f41bf3\n\nTowering over enemy combatants, the Magna Tri-droid acts as devastating artillery support for the Separatists. Armed with three heavy laser cannons, three rocket launchers, and the ability to call in an air-strike, this behemoth is a force to be reckoned with.\n\nAlthough it will be stationary and placed reasonably far away from combat, it’s ability to zoom in, as well as it’s quick-moving projectiles, more than make up for this.\n\nAt a cost of 500 BP, this unit acts like the MTT, AT-AT, and LAAT in the sense that you must get eliminations with it to extend the amount of time you have in it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r7zati6e3dp21.png?width=2493&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d329c5c199387fc7dbd13265a53db4de3cc7a7ae\n\n*Processing img q3eq6gif3dp21...*\n\nSkitter your way through the back alleys of Um’eh city and ambush Clones and Jedi alike as the Combat Tri-droid, the spider-like tank used by the Confederacy of Independent Systems. This nightmarish droid / walker hybrid will cost 900 BP, and have 650 health.\n\nDespite being tiny in comparison to it’s larger counterpart, the Combat Tri-droid leaves nothing to be desired in weapons and abilities. Armed with three rapid-fire laser cannons, a scan-pulse ability, an automatic repair ability, and an ability to launch three anti-infantry rockets this droid packs quite a punch.\n\n*Processing img o6ljavdi3dp21...*\n\nFurthermore, due to it’s agile nature this vehicle will be the first walker in the game capable of both crouching, and evading like a regular trooper (albeit somewhat slower). To counter this, a fan favourite from the original Battlefront II will be returning: the TX-130 Saber tank. More details will be shared in another Transmission closer to release.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ae24jq7k3dp21.png?width=2493&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aaa9f71145ac1e93299e8579cfc323fb0e39f0f1\n\nAs the Clones approach the bridge connecting the city and the main building, a ferocious blizzard blows throughout the city, rendering many homing weapons useless and nearly blinding the troopers on the battlefront. Like the sandstorm on Geonosis, the effects of the blizzard become greater over distance, making attempts at sniping the Clones on the bridge futile.\n\nThe reduced visibility also plays in favour of fast moving units like the Combat Tri-droid, the B-X Droid commando, and the BARC speeder, as they can now rush towards players head on; but only become visible once it’s too late.\n\nThe blizzard will continue to blow throughout phase 2, and can be seen outside the main building’s windows during phase 3 and 4.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t85dsz7n3dp21.png?width=2493&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5020077d111d8a3e4893ae979dac4de7aed803f5\n\nNew weapons and star cards have arguably been the most requested addition to Battlefront II aside from maps since launch, and we are happy to say that with the release of Mygeeto we will also be releasing 4 brand new weapons, as well as various star cards for the Assault, Heavy, Officer, and Specialist classes. The cards we are adding vary from a placable medical droid for the officer, to a devastating alternative to the Heavy’s Z-6 rotary cannon, the Reciprocating quad blaster.\n\nThe new weapons will get their own Community transmission closer to the end of the month, but in the meantime here is a brief description of what is coming.\n\nASSAULT\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the Assault, we are adding the DP-23. It is a shotgun with a low rate of fire intended for mid-range combat. Although it is devastating at the right distance, firing at an enemy that is too close will deal less damage. It also suffers from high recoil.\n\nHEAVY\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe heavy will be getting the DC-17. Although visually somewhat similar to the TL-50, the DC-17 has a lower rate of fire. This is made up for with an increased damage per bolt, and reduced spread.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOFFICER\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe officer’s new weapon will be the DC-15s side arm. It’s main strength is it’s cooling capabilities, which allow it to fire uninterrupted for a longer period of time than any other blaster currently in the game. If it overheats, however, it has an incredibly long cool down time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSPECIALIST\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nActing as a compromise between the NT-242 and the IQA-11, the DC-15x does more damage than the IQA-11, but with a slower rate of fire and slightly slower bolt speed. To help with darker environments, it has an unlockable night vision scope.\n\nNow then, it’s time to address another highly requested feature since the launch of the game while also satisfying our Original Trilogy fans.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/43qz2td14dp21.png?width=2493&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a79982d95dea016882bcb01bf47d2f7af4cd777\n\nMygeeto will be the first map in Star Wars Battlefront II to feature a Prequel Trilogy scenario, AND an Original Trilogy scenario. The Prequel scenario is covered fairly in depth in this Transmission, and the Original Trilogy scenario will receive it’s own Transmission closer to release.\n\nIn the meantime however, we can tell you that it’s based on the battle mentioned in the original novel “Battlefront: Twilight Company”. It will feature a brand new objective, new planet default skins for the Rebel Alliance (the sixty first mobile infantry), as well as additional parts of the map that are unreachable in the Prequel Trilogy version.\n\nFinally, as a teaser for what’s to come after Mygeeto has been released, players will travel to the misty world of Cato Neimoidia and fly throughout the shrouded cities as the Republic and CIS battle for ariel superiority….\n\n*Punch it.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n============================================================\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*This “Community Transmission” is simply a fan concept, and is in no way official or tied to DICE, Electronic Arts, or the Walt Disney Company.\n\nCredits:\n\nI (MajesticAndHolyWade) am responsible for the following:\n\nWriting the CT, re-creating the CT's artwork, character / prop rigging, character animation, camera animation, pre-visualization, layout, lighting, dynamic and procedural effects, compositing, audio-layout as well as minor sound effect creation, writing and digitally performing the original score, and modelling / texturing, with the exception of the following:\n\nVehicles: LAAT, BARC speeder, Hyena Bomber and AT-ST\n\nCharacters: B1 Battledroid, Clone trooper, Snow trooper, Snow rebel, and Iden Versio\n\nWeapons / misc: DC-15s, DC-15a, DC-17, Valken-38x, E-11, A280, TL-50, various pieces of scrap metal\n\nThese were modelled and textured by DICE. The galactic marine contains some of my own modelling (mask, pauldrons, backpack, and knee guards) as well as being completely retextured by me. The Clone tank driver's helmet shell was modelled and textured by me, and the body used a modified Clone trooper texture.\n\nThe spawn screen overlay and release date screens were created by DICE (and modified by me, to fit this project).\n\nAside from the music, I don't own anything in this project (as far as copyright is concerned).\n\nVoice acting was done by a friend of mine, Matt.\n\nA small behind the scenes video is in the works, but there is no ETA for it yet. /u/F8RGE, /u/EA_Charlemagne, I know DICE isn't supposed to use community ideas in the final game (although, if there's some weird IP law I'm unaware of, I'm happy to surrender whatever rights I have to this to DICE), so how about you look at this as a MASSIVE amount of fan art instead? (I'll give 'ya both a ride on the UT-AT if you actually do it, though)\n\nNow, there's one thing I want to say: I'm a prequel fan, no doubt about it, but I recognize we've had a pretty good run as of late, so I think it's completely fair if we get Scarif, or some other OT content first.\n\nThanks,",

        "selftext": "This post is a follow-up to u/Fly-Bottle's post titled [Libertarians, how do you feel about the fact that your ideology is essentially funded by billionaires?](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1jaay8f/libertarians_how_do_you_feel_about_the_fact_that/) I wrote a bit about this in another comment but I feel it deserves its own post because it's such a broad topic and really deserves more attention.\n\n# And to be clear (please read before continuing)\n\nI'm not saying that any of this funding ultimately discredits libertarianism or any of its principles nor is this post meant to be an attack on the libertarian movement or individual libertarians. The point of this is not to point fingers and say \"You're wrong because you're funded by bad guys!\"\n\nI'm in big part intending for this post to be a friendly warning to libertarians that many of the groups they follow are being funded by these industries and that this funding [sways their overall message](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funding_bias), that is after all why these groups dump such large funds into them, and they may be impacting your views in ways you would otherwise not realize.\n\nI am also aware not all of these are strictly \"libertarian\" but rather part of the broader conservative/liberty movement, but they're all groups I see people reference or cite articles from as evidence for their policies or proposed ideas so I think they're worth noting.\n\n# So who funds the libertarian movement?\n\nThis list is by NO MEANS definitive. If I were to write one it'd probably take weeks.\n\n[**The Cash for Comments Economist's Network**](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Cash_for_Comments_Economists_Network) is a disinformation network run by tobacco company lobbyists and employees whose primary purpose is to downplay the negative health effects of smoking by writing op-eds pushing their narrative, funding research that comes to conclusions favorable to the tobacco industry, and smearing anti-smoking campaigns.\n\nThey or their key members have funded or contributed significantly to:\n\n* The Mises Institute, several key personnel there are also members of CCEN ([Source](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Ludwig_von_Mises_Institute#Personnel))\n* The Cato Institute ([Source](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Cash_for_Comments_Economists_Network#Network_Establishment))\n* The Atlas Group ([Source](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Cash_for_Comments_Economists_Network#Network_Establishment))\n* The Center for Public Choice ([Source](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Cash_for_Comments_Economists_Network#Network_Establishment))\n* The Institute of Economic Affairs ([Source](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Cash_for_Comments_Economists_Network#Network_Establishment))\n* The American Enterprise Institute ([Source](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Cash_for_Comments_Economists_Network#Network_Establishment))\n* The Heritage Foundation ([Source](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Cash_for_Comments_Economists_Network#Network_Establishment))\n* The Reason Foundation ([Source](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Cash_for_Comments_Economists_Network#Network_Establishment))\n\n[**The Koch Brothers**](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Koch_Brothers), you know them already, they're responsible for a significant amount of disinformation regarding climate change, tobacco's health impact, unions, and many many other topics. They have also successfully influenced public policy and the Republican Party platform on multiple occasions. Most of their activities happen through orgs they own such as [Americans for Prosperity](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Americans_for_Prosperity#Tobacco) and [Stand Together (aka Stand Together Chamber of Commerce)](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Stand_Together_Chamber_of_Commerce).

So what if they gave them a few dollars once? They also donated to other non-think tank groups so why is it only bad when they donate to these?\"\n\nFor one, it wasn't a few bucks. You can see in the sources it was tens, sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars over the span of several years. Several of these think tanks and groups are getting funding from multiple different foundations within the same industry or that are run by the same billionaire families - many are receiving annual donations.\n\nSecond, the purpose of these donations is to sway their opinion and to get them to support causes they support. We know they're doing this on purpose from [leaked documents and evidence in court cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_industry_playbook) which outlined how they sowed disinformation and created the illusion of controversies surrounding topics there was already a scientific consensus on.\n\nIt isn't a coincidence that The Cato Institute takes funding from fossil fuel companies and then starts [campaigns challenging the scientific consensus on climate change](https://www.cato.org/commentary/political-assault-climate-skeptics) or the Heritage foundation publishes [articles making false claims that there is more evidence coming out showing climate change isn't a big deal](https://www.heritage.org/environment/commentary/different-perspective-global-warming), it isn't a coincidence that the Mises Institute takes funding from the tobacco industry and then shares articles about [why smokers are actually oppressed minorities](https://mises.org/mises-wire/tobacco-smokers-americas-most-persecuted-minority). These orgs are trying to appeal to their funders.\n\nAnd this has a real impact besides just articles posted online a few econ nerds may read. The Cato Institute [funds universities, has affected policy making, and its members have been called on as experts in the media](https://www.cato.org/support/impact-test), The Heritage Foundation is [currently influencing the Trump administration's policies](https://www.heritage.org/impact/trump-administration-embraces-heritage-foundation-policy-recommendations).\n\n# \"But this says nothing about the overall message! Just what they're saying about climate change and tobacco smoking!\"\n\nLike I said, this is a fraction of the billionaire and millionaire funding libertarian think tanks receive, and it isn't all from these industries - they just happen to be influential and noteworthy contributors. All these think tanks have spoken out against different policies not directly related to climate change or smoking because they were unfavorable to these industries, often citing libertarian principles as a reason.\n\nFor example Cato [published an article about why action against climate change was authoritarian and bad for the economy from a libertarian standpoint](https://www.cato.org/publications/climate-change-national-security-balancing-costs-benefits#benefits), The Mises Institute [argued against tobacco regulation by calling them authoritarian and drawing parallels between them and Nazism](https://mises.org/free-market/are-cigarettes-doomed), The Reason Foundation [conducted a dubious research concluding that policies regularly pushed by fossil fuel companies were the most beneficial way to combat climate change and emphasized the lower taxes and increased competition which reconciled with their libertarian views](https://reason.org/policy-study/evidence-based-policies-to-slow-climate-change/), Americans for Prosperity [successfully lobbied against American Clean Energy and Security Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Clean_Energy_and_Security_Act) which Cato and Heritage also argued against with dubious cost figures.",

Removing safety regulations and taxes would not mean that companies would start selling unsafe products or exploiting workers. On the contrary, competition and consumer choice would set the level of quality and fairness for companies.\n\nThe concept of “slave wages” only arises when the government intervenes and distorts the labor market. In a free market, where everything is voluntary, wages are determined by the supply and demand for labor. If a company were to exploit workers, it would face rapid competition that would offer better conditions.\n\nIn reality, the government often supports monopolies, allows for profiteering, and prevents real competition by creating barriers to new entrants. The solution is not more government, but less. A legitimate free market is one in which individuals are free to enter markets, trade, and create without artificial barriers.",

He started out as Rep. Devin Nunes’ aide, writing a memo that alleged FBI bias against Trump and attempted to discredit the investigation into Russian election interference. He was on Trump’s National Security Council, was reportedly part of Giuliani’s backchannel to Ukraine, and was later appointed to Defense Department Chief of Staff.\n\n* The same WaPo report also revealed that Patel botched a 2020 hostage rescue mission in Nigeria: “Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were angry that, in their view, Patel had prematurely said the operation was fully cleared...One senior Pentagon official said he was ‘incensed’ at Patel. A second senior Pentagon official described Patel’s actions as potentially ‘dangerous’ for the SEALs.”\n\n**A new report released by the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General revealed that Trump’s deployment of law enforcement to Portland, OR, last summer cost $12.3 million.** The IG notes ([PDF](https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2021-04/OIG-21-31-Mar21.pdf)) that the estimated damage caused to Hatfield Courthouse, which DHS and FPS were guarding, only cost $1.6 million. Additionally, few of the officers had been trained in riot and crowd control, even though that was their primary mission:\n\n&gt;The inspector general’s office [examined](https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2021/04/federal-agents-sent-to-portland-to-defend-courthouse-lacked-consistent-training-equipment-or-use-of-force-policies-report-says.html) one day, Aug. 7, and found that of 222 officers deployed to Portland, 36 didn’t appear on a training roster showing they had received a legal briefing on their authority or the criminal laws they could enforce on federal property. Fourteen of those 36 officers used less-lethal munitions against people in Portland, increasing the department’s liability, the report said… In a review of 63 officers, only seven had received riot or crowd control training, according to the inspector general’s office.\n\n**The same IG, Joseph Cuffari, blocked career officials’ plan to investigate the role of the Secret Service in clearing protestors from Lafayette Square last June.** Cuffari served as a policy advisor for Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey before being nominated and confirmed as DHS IG in 2019. The Lafayette incident was widely criticized as the protesters were peaceful and were violently cleared for Trump to stage a photo op. The Project on Government Oversight (POGO) [obtained](https://www.pogo.org/investigation/2021/04/pulling-punches-trump-appointed-watchdog-suppressed-white-house-related-probes/) documents that revealed Cuffari’s role:\n\n&gt;Cuffari’s decision to avoid delving into such sensitive issues in the run-up to a presidential election inevitably raises questions about his role as an independent and non-partisan watchdog overseeing one of the largest and most consequential Cabinet departments… Unlike most other Trump appointees, but typical for inspectors general, Cuffari remains in his role during the Biden administration.\n\nCuffari also blocked an investigation into the Secret Service’s coronavirus protocols - which appeared to be regularly disregarded. “At one point, more than 130 agents, or about 10% of the agency’s core security personnel, were ordered to isolate or quarantine after testing positive for COVID-19,” POGO states.\n\n**Recently acquired documents have provided evidence that the Trump administration used “covert surveillance” to monitor and “infiltrate” racial justice protests last summer.** Nonprofit watchdog CREW [obtained](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/emails-show-deas-covert-surveillance-of-racial-justice-protesters-in-philadelphia-chicago-albuquerque/) internal DOJ emails in which Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) officials assigned undercover agents to “identify protest leaders” within Philadelphia's protests and instructed those in the field to download a “communications app” to carry out their “surveillance operation”. Separately, The Intercept revealed [emails](https://theintercept.com/2021/04/22/drones-black-lives-matter-protests-marshals/) indicating that the U.S. Marshals Service flew unmanned drones over Washington, D.C., on June 5 and 7 to surveil Black Lives Matter rallies:\n\n&gt;[The email] states that a redacted entity “responded to Washington DC” and “conducted one flight,” the same day Mayor Muriel Browser asked Donald Trump to “withdraw all extraordinary law enforcement and military presence from Washington, DC.”  \n\n* Related: “D.C. Guard misused helicopters in low-flying confrontation with George Floyd protesters, Army concludes,” [WaPo](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/04/15/dc-guard-helicopter-george-floyd-protest/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=wp_main)\n\n* Related: “Police Say an Antifa Activist Likely Shot at Officers. His Gun Suggests Otherwise,” [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/10/us/michael-reinoehl-killing-investigation.html). “Police radio problems led to chaotic scene when officers killed Portland activist,” [OPB](https://www.opb.org/article/2021/04/07/police-radio-problems-led-to-chaotic-scene-when-officers-killed-portland-activist/).\n\n**The Housing and Urban Development Dept. Inspector General concluded that Trump officials intentionally blocked $20 billion in hurricane relief to Puerto Rico.** IG Rae Oliver Davis [said](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/new-probe-confirms-trump-officials-blocked-puerto-rico-receiving-hurri-rcna749) the aid was “unnecessarily delayed by bureaucratic obstacles,” like a new and unexplained review requirement imposed by the Office of Management and Budget (led by Trump loyalist Mick Mulvaney, at the time). Davis also reported ([PDF](https://www.hudoig.gov/sites/default/files/2021-04/HUD%20OIG%20Final%20Report_2019SU008945I.pdf)) that the administration delayed and obstructed her investigation; top HUD officials - including Secretary Ben Carson - refused to be interviewed by investigators.\n\n---\n---\n\n##Corruption\n\n**Former Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao repeatedly used her position and agency staff to support her family’s shipping business, leading the Inspector General to refer the case to the DOJ for possible criminal investigation.** Chao, the wife of Senator Mitch McConnell, [involved](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/03/elaine-chao-dot-inspector-general-report-473536) family members in her planned official trip to China - where her family's shipping company, Foremost Group, does significant business (note: the trip was canceled after media attention led to criticism). She provided Transportation Dept. public affairs support to her father and used staff for personal tasks:\n\n&gt;A review of DOT emails and interviews with staff revealed that OST staffers provided various\nmedia and public affairs support to the Secretary’s father in 2017 and 2018. In addition to the\nplanned book signing in China, there were several additional instances where OST staff were\ndirected to help promote Dr. Chao’s biography, Fearless Against the Wind. ([PDF](https://www.oig.dot.gov/sites/default/files/DOT%20OIG%20Letter%20to%20Chairman%20Peter%20DeFazio_2021-03-02.pdf))\n\nThe IG referred the case to the DOJ on Dec. 16, 2020, for potential criminal charges. The Department - led by then-Attorney General Bill Barr - declined to take it up, saying “there may be ethical and/or administrative issues to address but there is not predication to open a criminal investigation.” \n\n* Reminder: The IG leading the investigation into Chao, Mitch Behm, was abruptly demoted by Trump in May 2020, leaving an acting official in the position. The day after the IG’s office referred the case to the DOJ for prosecution, McConnell brought Trump’s nominee for permanent IG to the floor for a vote. Days later, Eric Soskin was confirmed to the position (and is still there).\n\n---\n---\n\n##Pandemic-related investigations\n\n**House Democrats have opened an investigation into Emergent BioSolutions, the company that botched millions of Covid-19 vaccine doses, and its close relationship with a Trump official.** House Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney and Coronavirus panel Chair James Clyburn [sent](https://oversight.house.gov/news/press-releases/maloney-and-clyburn-launch-investigation-into-emergent-biosolutions-profits-and) a letter to the top executives last week seeking information on the $628 million federal contract Emergent was given in June 2020:\n\n&gt;“Specifically, we are investigating reports that Emergent received multi-million-dollar contracts to manufacture coronavirus vaccines despite a long, documented history of inadequately trained staff and quality control issues… Dr. Robert Kadlec, who served as Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response under President Trump and previously worked as a consultant for Emergent, appears to have pushed for this award despite indications that Emergent did not have the ability to reliably fulfill the contract.”\n\nClyburn called upon Emergent’s President and CEO, Robert Kramer, and Emergent’s Executive Chairman, Fuad El-Hibri, to testify at a hearing on May 19, 2021.\n\n*New information: CEO Kramer [sold](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/emergent-robert-kramer-stock-sales/2021/04/25/de151434-a2b6-11eb-a7ee-949c574a09ac_story.html) more than $10 million worth of his stock in the company in January and early February - just weeks before the stock price tumbled from $125/share to $62/share. In other words, he would have lost $5.5 million had he not sold before the plant’s failure was publicly disclosed.* \n\n* 15 million doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s coronavirus vaccine that were manufactured at Emergent’s plant were thrown out; no doses made there have gone to the public. The New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/21/us/politics/emergent-johnson-johnson-covid-vaccine.html) that problems at the plant were known during the Trump administration: “A series of confidential audits last year, obtained by The Times, warned about risks of viral and bacterial contamination and a lack of proper sanitation at the Baltimore plant.”\n\n* Whistleblower Rick Bright, former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, filed a complaint around the time of the Emergent award [warning](https://www.rollcall.com/2020/06/10/trump-health-officials-approach-to-contracts-faces-scrutiny/) that Kadlec and other officials were awarding lucrative contracts to former business acquaintances and friends, instead of focusing on projects with scientific merit.\n\n**Nearly a full year ago, the Trump administration awarded $1.3 billion to a company that promised to make vaccine syringes, yet none have been delivered to date.** The Defense Department and Health and Human Services first [contracted](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/trump-administration-awarded-firm-1-3-billion-make-covid-vaccine-n1263872) with ApiJect Systems in May 2020 to produce inexpensive prefilled plastic syringes; in November 2020, the company received a $590 million loan to build a “gigafactory” for the product that would create 650 jobs. So far, the syringes have not been FDA approved and the construction of the factory has not begun.\n\n* Contrary to the conservative “Made in America” nationalism, nearly [every step](https://www.cato.org/blog/covid-19-vaccines-depend-globalization-therefore-so-does-trump-administration) in researching, developing, manufacturing, and distributing the coronavirus vaccine has been a global effort. For instance, most of Pfizer’s vaccine production is done in Belgium, using supply chains that stretch from Egypt to China. The U.S. [imports](https://wits.worldbank.org/trade/comtrade/en/country/USA/year/2018/tradeflow/Imports/partner/ALL/nomen/h5/product/901831) syringes from China, Mexico, Germany, and Israel, among other countries.

            "body": "Just to highlight this, because it increasingly appears that a federal agents and local law enforcement (Thurston County, WA) murdered a man (who was accused of shooting and killing a Trump supporter):\n\n&gt;While investigators found a spent bullet casing in the back seat of Mr. Reinoehl’s car, and pointed to that as evidence he probably fired his weapon, the handgun they recovered from Mr. Reinoehl had a full magazine, according to multiple photos compiled by Thurston County authorities showing Mr. Reinoehl’s handgun. The gun was found in his pocket.\n\n&gt;...But one of the witnesses that Thurston County investigators relied on to reach their conclusion that Mr. Reinoehl had fired his gun was an 8-year-old boy... Of the two other witnesses who investigators cited to support the conclusion that Mr. Reinoehl fired his gun, one did not see it happen and the other was not sure...\n\n&gt;Although he did not see a gun, Deputy Oleole said, he began firing his AR-15 rifle through his own windshield at Mr. Reinoehl. Officer Merrill, thinking the glass shards from the windshield meant he was under fire, exited the Ford Escape, saw what he believed was Mr. Reinoehl reaching for a gun, and also opened fire.\n\n&gt;...The final report also does not address the fact that the handgun’s six-round magazine was still full when officers recovered it. [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/10/us/michael-reinoehl-killing-investigation.html)\n\nYou may remember, after Reinoehl was killed by police, Trump [praised](https://www.vox.com/2020/9/14/21436216/trump-michael-reinoehl-protests-portland-shooting) the officers:\n\n&gt;“Now we sent in the US marshals for the killer, the man that killed the young man in the street,” Trump told Judge Jeanine. “Two and a half days went by, and I put out [on Twitter], ‘When are you going to go get him?’ And the US marshals went in to get in, and in a short period of time, they ended in a gunfight. This guy was a violent criminal, and the US marshals killed him. And I’ll tell you something — that’s the way it has to be. There has to be retribution when you have crime like this.”\n\n&gt;During his rally on Saturday night in Minden, Nevada, Trump alluded to Reinoehl’s killing and lauded US marshals for doing a “great job,” adding, darkly, “you know what I mean.”",

I will say that I'm glad I stood up with BLM, even if it meant getting flash banged, tear gassed and shot at with pepper rounds for the very terrible awful crime of standing in a park.

I don’t have the private up but since they use their own master ip block I limit critical access to just that range. We looked at zscale. Lot of nice looking features but their sales was pushy and confusing, along with pricing all over the place. We also looking store locations. We can get rid of vpn tunnels as ztna will allow the needed access and allow us to isolate the remote sites",

Think in terms of mature and effective threat prevention for your private network, assuming you have a private network you still need to maintain and secure. This is a limiting factor with their solution, so it's advisable that you still keep edge and/or DC firewalls inline their solution and the private resources you're dishing out to your user/non-user endpoints.\n\nZscaler does have the \"Cloud Firewall\" that adds some layer of protection, and they can even extend that down to the edge, but it's not so easy to design, manage and support. \n\nCato provides all security services inline between all users (and non-users) from branch to anywhere...from datacenter to datacenter....cloud to cloud, etc. The idea is that their cloud platform sits in between all edges, regardless of the type of edge.",

Zscaler are extremely aggressive on the pre-sales process. \n\nWe looked at Cloudflare but it just lacked functionality, this might’ve changed since then. Cato - no idea although I believe Netskope has almost 50% more POPs (130 vs 170) but check this. \n\nRegardless it was a huge challenge to implement. Make sure you get good support from the vendor during your rollout. Take a look at their Dedicated IPs offering, expensive but much more reliable for critical apps. Once you have it in, the visibility is next level - the TLS interception massively helps with threat detection. So much visibility and control. Good luck with your journey 👍",

Each supplier is going to do it's best to emphasize this point in a way that reflects the biggest possible number, assuming the number is what's most important to the customer. \n\nCompanies like Netskope and Zscaler count datacenters, which don't always reflect the true global footprint/distribution in a way that resonates with global organizations. Cato counts unique markets they are in versus datacenters. If you're a global organization and care about distribution of coverage, then the market count is probably most important. It doesn't matter as much that you have (5) Datacenters in London and so that adds (5) to your overall PoP count. It matters more, assuming you can support the customer load, that you have presence in London. To that extent, Cato is as distributed (or even more distributed) as Netskope. Zscaler is not so distributed. They have a high datacenter count, but they don't have service symmetry within those Datacenters or markets. This dilutes their count/distribution a bit more.  \n\nSome numbers right off their respective websites:\n\nCato Networks - 87 unique markets (service symmetry)  \nNetskope - 77 unique markets (service symmetry)  \nZscaler - 68 unique markets (service asymmetry, not all markets have all services available for all customers)",

Can't evaluate everyone. Pulling back the tarp reveals a lot of distinction, though.\n\nFor full SASE adoption, nobody does it better than Cato Networks, IMO. They have the biggest global footprint. Their solution was/is purpose built to address the real challenges for enterprises that drove SASE to surface, e.g. reducing risk by reducing complexity. If you consider this point, then there really aren't many options out there that compete or come close to Cato. That being said, there are other solutions that do a part of SASE very well, and as good as Cato. Consider Netskope, for example, really strong on the Cloud App Security side of things. This was their focus from the onset and it's clear they are the market leader there. Zscaler really showed strength earlier on with Cloud based internet security. They focused on a world that would be nothing but HTTP/s. They do that part really well. Considering the world is not yet solely HTTP/s, if you're needs extend out to other ports/protocols and use cases, Zscaler has it's shortcomings.\n\nIf your goal is really a strategy that mirrors that of the goals of SASE then Cato really is the leader in the space. It doesn't do every little thing (yet) as well as the one thing that other suppliers might do...but it does everything better than any other supplier trying to do everything does. Everything being everything that's material to SASE, of course.",

        "selftext": "Hey Apes, Crux here. I found another part of the Citadel Empire that I have not been able to find any media reporting on. This one involves a political think tank, or some kind of philanthropic venture, that Ken Griffin is starting named “Griffin Catalyst.”\n\n**First**, the domain griffincatalyst.com was registered to Citadel on September 21, 2021: [https://www.whois.com/whois/griffincatalyst.com](https://www.whois.com/whois/griffincatalyst.com)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0c4lslttfq5a1.png?width=688&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a80fd9b01d1932b6c7b0a256da121549dd0fd772\n\n**Second**, a trademark for “Griffin Catalyst” was filed less than a month ago, on November 23, 2022: [https://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4804:dllhjk.7.1](https://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4804:dllhjk.7.1) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gbxondnwfq5a1.jpg?width=336&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f70271d542af2cb2dbc1d2dadea2932be411b7b9\n\nThe address listed is Citadel’s new Miami headquarters, and the owner is **CE TM Holdings LLC**, which I have [previously reported on as the entity holding Citadel’s intellectual property](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/pxn9zj/alpha_league_mercury_dark_ignition_better_markets/). \n\nThe “Goods and Services” filed with the trademark breaks down what this could be related to (emphasis mine):\n\n&gt;IC 035. US 100 101 102. G &amp; S: philanthropic services, namely, promoting public awareness of charitable, philanthropic, public policy, and humanitarian activities; promoting public interest and awareness in the fields of advancing democracy, healthcare, scientific and medical research, economic mobility and community development; **public advocacy to promote awareness and improvement in the fields of advancing democracy, healthcare, scientific and medical research, economic mobility and community development**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;IC 036. US 100 101 102. G &amp; S: philanthropic and charitable services, namely, **providing gifts to charitable organizations and social entrepreneurs in the fields of advancing democracy, healthcare, scientific and medical research, economic mobility and community development**; charitable foundation services, namely, providing financial assistance for programs and services of others; philanthropic services, namely, **providing capital in the form of grants, gifts, investments and other means for programs and services that provide societal benefit through scientific and medical research, technology, and economic empowerment**; financial sponsorship of research and development in the fields of scientific and medical research and technology  \n&gt;  \n&gt;IC 041. US 100 101 107. G &amp; S: **arranging and conducting educational congresses, educational conferences, meetings in the nature of educational seminars and in-person educational forums, all to discuss issues related to advancing democracy, healthcare, scientific and medical research, economic empowerment and community development**\n\nSo Griffin Catalyst could be a lot of things, but what is interesting about these “Goods and Services” is how they are similar to trademarks filed for other well-known political think tanks like the Heritage Foundation and the Cato Institute.\n\nNote: I picked these because of Griffin’s known republican/libertarian leanings and prior involvement with the Koch Brothers who founded/funded those organizations.\n\n**Heritage Foundation**: [https://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/jumpto?f=doc&amp;state=4810:zyljir.2.60](https://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/jumpto?f=doc&amp;state=4810:zyljir.2.60)\n\n&gt;IC 041. US 100 101 107. G &amp; S: Educational, entertainment and conference services, namely, organizing and conducting cultural events, providing displays and exhibits, conducting educational programs, seminars, lectures, conferences, workshops, providing facilities for educational conventions, providing educational speakers and libraries in the fields of conservative public policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, a strong national defense, the heritage of the United States government, the philosophies of its founders and how they apply to current issues facing the United States; providing on-line publications in the nature of e-books, magazines, newsletters, reports, and brochures in the field of conservative public policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, a strong national defense, the heritage of the United States government, the philosophies of its founders and how they apply to current issues facing the United State; publication of books, magazines, newsletters, annual reports, and brochures in the field of conservative public policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, a strong national defense, the heritage of the United States government, the philosophies of its founders and how they apply to current issues facing the United States. FIRST USE: 19730301. FIRST USE IN COMMERCE: 19730301\n\n**Cato Institute**: [https://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4805:gzox5n.2.1](https://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4805:gzox5n.2.1)\n\n&gt;IC 016. US 002 005 022 023 029 037 038 050. G &amp; S: Paper and printed matter, namely, periodicals, studies, newsletters and books in the fields of political analysis, constitutional studies, educational freedom, global liberty and prosperity, representative government, trade policy, defense and foreign policy, economic studies, economic population studies, population welfare studies, monetary and financial alternatives, criminal justice, government oversight studies, tax and budget, and privacy; publications, namely, books and magazines in the fields of political analysis and economic population studies. FIRST USE: 19770600. FIRST USE IN COMMERCE: 19770600  \n&gt;  \n&gt;IC 041. US 100 101 107. G &amp; S: Educational services, namely, arranging and conducting educational conferences in the field of political analysis and economic population studies; publication of books and magazines in the field of political analysis and economic population studies; educational services, namely, workshops, seminars, classes, webinars, and panel discussions through websites, social media, and audio and video recording in the fields of political analysis, constitutional studies, educational freedom, global liberty and prosperity, representative government, trade policy, defense and foreign policy, economic studies, economic population studies, population welfare studies, monetary and financial alternatives, criminal justice, government oversight studies, tax and budget, and privacy and homeland security issues and educational materials distributed therewith, namely, e-newsletters. FIRST USE: 19770600. FIRST USE IN COMMERCE: 19770600\n\nGriffin Catalyst does not appear to be as defense/criminal justice oriented as Heritage/Cato, but there are similarities, especially when you consider Griffin's politics and his association with the Koch's and others in their network.\n\nI am but a simple ape, but it feels like something is amiss given how Griffin has inserted himself not just into American politics, but [potentially UK politics too](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/s9h488/buying_political_influence_in_the_uk_evidence/).\n\nAnd this action fits the billionaire fraudster’s playbook from the investigative reporters at [Whale Hunting](https://whalehunting.projectbrazen.com/ftx-a-whale-hunters-delight/) / Project Brazen:\n\n* Deflect attention onto your rivals.\n* Build a fake charitable reputation.\n* Buy media influence.\n* Fill political coffers with money.\n* Sportswashing.\n* High-minded, yet empty, promises and words.\n\nI hope I am wrong and Griffin Catalyst is a purely altruistic endeavor. Time will tell.",

        "selftext": "A bit of background, I've been in the industry 12 years mostly deploying Cisco and Meraki, occasionally working on other vendor platforms as well. I've experienced enough SD-WAN to understand the main concepts and caveats. These days there are hundreds of solutions on the market, and I don't have the time to explore each one. I'm looking for recommendations on what I'd describe as \"SD-WAN lite.\"\n\n  \nPrimary functionality/requirements:\n\n\\- WAN failover\n\n\\- Simple traffic direction. E.g. VLAN X routes out WAN 1, VLAN Y routes out WAN 2.\n\n\\- Basic IPsec tunneling and failover. Throughput requirements for IPsec are minimal\n\n\\- Ease of management (GUI), but ability to view low level configurations\n\n\\- 5 Gbps + throughput and ability for support of 3000 + users connecting to the internet (majority of traffic will be from the LAN, NATed, and forwarded. No security features required for this)\n\n\\- High availability/SSO pairing or a redundancy pairing setup\n\n\\- Standard traffic analytics and performance\n\n\\- Simple and reasonable licensing requirements (would be nice if the solution continued to function without license renewal)\n\n\\- Simple setup. Ideally has centralized management, but the forwarding logic is maintained locally. Centralized control plane/management requiring numerous beefy servers or proprietary appliances is not ideal.\n\n\\- Quality technical support \n\n\n\nNice to have:\n\n\\- Advanced security features, but would be used infrequently.\n\n\\- Ability to apply templates when deploying.\n\n\\- API based configuration and management.\n\n\\- Netflow support.\n\n\\- BGP support, not a requirement.\n\n  \nFeatures NOT needed/wanted:\n\n\\- Multipathing/WAN bandwidth aggregation through tunneling. \n\n\\- MPLS/VPLS - not required or desired in any manner, whether it's integration or emulation.\n\n\\- Cloud integration with AWS/Azure/Gcloud etc. - unneeded.\n\n\n\nI'll be exploring Peplink in the coming weeks. As for Meraki, the MX model requirements for 5 Gbps + throughput is double the cost of an enterprise router with similar throughput. I understand why, but usage of security features will be minimal in this scenario. I know that Fortinet is a popular solution as well, but I am personally not a fan of their products.\n\n  \nThank you in advance!\n\n",

I've been balls deep in SD-WAN for about 10 years. \n\nPeople in this sub LOVE the Fortinet solution. It's really an engineer's product, which is why it's loved so much around here. Personally I think Fortinet is way too complicated, which is why they give it away for free. It's really just WAN Link Load Balancing rebranded with some additional features. You still have to build the dialup tunnels, internal routing protocols, provisioning strategy, all that stuff is on you. These elements are all part of the reference architecture, but it's the complete opposite of turn key. \n\nVelo is my personal favorite, however we're all waiting for the other shoe to drop with Broadcom right now. No one knows what the future of that product line is at the moment. I really like Silverpeak too, that would be my second pick (now owned by Aruba). \n\nIf you want something dead simple and easy to deploy, Meraki is a good choice. It's for people who just want to connect sites together with some light SD-WAN features",

You can follow fortinet guides or continue using the routing protocols and architecture you use today since fortigates are capable of handling almost all network technologies you throw at it. The SD-WAN feature makes it easy to combine those interfaces to have load-balancing, SLA monitoring, different routing path depending on the type of trafic,etc. on top of your network architecture without the need to think about asymmetric routing. For me it's the most robust way to build it as you know already how to troubleshoot your network and it's usually easier to troubleshoot than a blackbox that \"does everything automagically\". I hate Merakis for this, it just works that's true, but when it doesn't it isn't as easy to fix. If you don't have a good network, yes those blackboxes work great.",

VLAN X routes out WAN 1, VLAN Y routes out WAN 2.\n\n  \nThat's not SDWAN...that's policy-based routing, and something nearly every firewall can do.\n\n  \nSDWAN, IMO, is poricy-based routing, on crack.  Regular health-checks and on-box performance monitoring of multiple links and dynamically routing traffic over the best link(s) for the type of traffic -- voice goes over the lowest-jitter link; OneDrive goes over the highest-speed link, for an example.  VPNs between remote sites follow the same types rules (you have VPNs over each link and choose the best for the type of traffic based upon health/performance check SLAs).  Depending on topology and business needs, this may even be a full/partial-mesh VPN with tunnels dynamically generated.  \n\nAnd really...all the vendors do this about the same, too.  IMO it's a matter of which platforms you are comfortable with, which vendors you have a good relationship/experience with, and what integrates well with your existing and near-future tools.  (i.e. can it get user/device information from your NAC/MDM/SSO/IPAM? Is that valuable to routing decisions or logs?).  And of course, budget.\n\n  \nFortinet does tick all your boxes.  L7 firewalling is their meat-and-potatoes and their SDWAN is a very mature pillar of that platform.  I'm a bit of a forti-fanboi though, so take with a grain of salt.\n\nI will say this, my observation of the state of SDWAN....there are a few lineages of modern SDWAN appliances and where they came from.  Knowing their lineage will help in generalizing which will best suit your needs, as this tends to be where they really shine.\n\n  \n\\- WAN Optimization -- Silverpeak came from this family.\n\n\\- Firewalling and L4+ security -- Fortinet came from this family\n\n\\- SaaS On-Ramping -- Aryaka came from this family\n\n\\- Route-based VPN -- Cisco/Viptella came from this family.",

Scaling to over a hundred locations with these configs adds a lot of work to the senior engineer's queues, whether it is troubleshooting or the requests which require temporary policy changes.

Google resume templates, tons of free ones. Make sure they're ATS friendly. Back to the main point, the formatting is so off-putting that I didn't bother to read anything closely. Rule of thumb, if the one page (really should be just one page btw) makes your eyes hurt just seeing it, no one is going to take the time to really read it. I'm betting that the bullet points are repetitive between jobs. If so, every bullet point should be unique even if it's the same position from company to company. Use each point to highlight a different skill, or word it differently. Also include some numbers. Something quantitative carries more weight. \n\nGood luck to him!!!\n\nEdit: typo",

        "title": "CATO's Freedom in the 50 States: Positions of Orthodox American Libertarians ",
        "selftext": "If you weren’t aware, the Cato Institute’s “Freedom in the 50 States” is the definitive libertarian analysis of how free American states are in social, personal, and economic realms, state by state, policy by policy.\n\nThe tome starts with 100 pages of theory roughly defining freedom and ends with the dirty regulatory secrets of every one of the Stars &amp; Stripes. Of most interest is in between, where it provides the kosher libertarian review on over 26 policy domains, broken into fiscal, regulatory, and personal freedom buckets.\n\nCurious to see what authors William P. Ruger and Jason Sorens had to say in this 6th edition — especially regarding the Empire State, crown jewel of America — I went through and categorized every policy stance they hold. Reflecting my own biases, I’ve divided them into *The Good, The Meh,* and *The Ugly.* My own attitudes divide between pragmatic economic policies that libertarians share at times, and pragmatic social policies that libertarians often denounce. Feel free to dispute or endorse for collective discussion and education.\n\nPrepare for a whirlwind of 1001 things that libertarians are *against*! (And, saving you the specious cost estimates of how much things like trans-fats bans are taking from Uncle Sam's wallet!\n\n# The Good\n\n* **Land Use Policy** —&gt; Against land use regulations/zoning laws, for the right to business owners to prohibit employees from bringing guns into their parking lot (hilarious stance but consistent)\n* **Labor Market** —&gt; Against requirements for verification of legal resident status.\n* **Occupations** —&gt; Pro-expansive scope of practice laws in medicine, Nurse Licensure Compact (and licensure compacts in general)\n* **Miscellaneous Regulations** —&gt; Against certificates of need for hospital construction, moving company entry regulations, pro direct-to-consumer automobile sales, pro interstate insurance product regulation compact\n   * [Good call by Cato, this is up there with the Jones Act in terms of ridiculousness](https://www.cato.org/commentary/missouris-mover-monopoly#)\n* **Incarceration and Arrests** —&gt; Against arrests for prostitution, marijuana possession, liquor law violations, driver’s license suspensions for drug offenses, loitering, gun possession, collect call rates on phones for prisoners.\n   * Pause on guns — would want evidence on if it's not an effective policing tactic to prevent violent crimes\n* **Marriage Freedom** —&gt; “In our view, state governments should treat marriage as a contract that is ‘registered’ or ‘recorded,’ rather than a personal status that is ‘licensed.’” (76) Fair enough! Also against mandatory blood testing, which I didn’t know the history of but is an invasive approach to STDs ([largely gone now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premarital_medical_examination), done in response to syphilis)\n* **Marijuana Freedom** —&gt; In short, for it\n* **Asset Forfeiture** —&gt; Opposed to proceeds of seized assets going to the agency, or the requirement to file suit for the return of your property \n   * Yeah that’s pretty messed up, good catch Cato\n* **Mala Prohibita** —&gt; Pro fireworks, prostitution, physician-assisted suicide, MMA legalization, DNA samples from criminal suspects without probable cause hearings\n* **Miscellaneous** —&gt; Pro sidewalk and parking space dining, private businesses right to vaccine requirements, against parking minimums\n\n# The Meh\n\n* All their takes on **Fiscal Policy** \\--&gt; They oppose state taxes, government consumption, local taxes, government employment, excessive government debt, etc. on standard crowd-out grounds. \n   * Fair enough, but worth noting that they do absolutely zero evaluation of the benefits from government spending and services. \n* **Land Use Policy** —&gt; Propose the use of homeowners associations as a contractual solution to land-use externalities — which runs counter to freedom to build, in my view. Same issues with deed restrictions, from what I’m aware of. Doesn’t address the perverse incentive of homeowners to restrict housing supply\n* **Land Use Policy** —&gt; Against “renewable portfolio standards,” which require businesses to have a certain proportion of energy from renewable sources. \n   * Not an expert, but: probably inefficient, but maybe a necessary evil given the economics of fossil fuel affordability.\n* **Health Insurance** —&gt; They dislike prior approval rates, bans on financial incentives to providers, standing referrals to specialists, and bans on elimination riders\n* **Labor Market** —&gt; Against stricter-than-federal anti-discrimination laws regarding smoking/marital status/age. \n   * Fair enough to note that anti-discrimination laws can have perverse effects, but I’d need to see data that their costs were outweighing the liberal position of freedom from discrimination. Opposition on the principle that “some discrimination by an employer is okay” is weak, and the fact that it will inevitably happen doesn’t mean there shouldn’t be laws about it in the fraction of cases where it does cause harm that should be addressed by the legal system.\n* **Lawsuits** —&gt; Support “tort reform,” which I take a dim view of. \n   * Using legal costs to businesses as a way to limit the ability of consumers to gain compensation is a cause championed by businesses seeking to avoid paying for harms, IMO. Maybe there are some reasonable reforms to make, but on the balance seems like a bad take.\n* **Occupations** —&gt; Dismissive of how effective sunrise and sunset laws are on occupational licensing boards, which they’re probably right about. Area for reform noted. They support physician assistant prescription authority, which I am wary of from a public health point of view given the opioid epidemic, but don’t have a strong stance on.\n* **Cable and Telecom** —&gt; For telecom deregulation… dunno nothing about this pet issue, but ease of firm entry seems like a fair interest.\n* **Miscellaneous Regulations**\n   * Against automobile insurance rate filing requirements , homeowner’s insurance rate filing requirements —&gt; No clue about these, no opinion. They seem to support something called “[Auto Choice](https://www.cato.org/commentary/auto-insurance-needs-auto-choice#)” that I’d have to read up on. On the other hand, [at least one policy analyst](https://norcalrecord.com/stories/658395251-cato-institute-policy-analyst-it-s-hard-to-get-homeowners-insurance-in-most-of-california) attributed unaffordability of homeowner’s insurance to state price controls and regulations after CA wildfires… I’m inclined to believe that’s convenient attribution, given that wildfires are becoming one of those “[uninsurable](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/09/21/parts-of-america-are-becoming-uninsurable)” situations due to factors beyond silly price laws.\n   * Against price gouging, sales-below-cost laws —&gt; Sure these are stupid in principle, and rarely do anything, but.. they *specifically* call out how price gouging after natural disasters is good ? I respect the contrarianism hustle but that’s just stone deaf\n   * Against mandatory product labeling laws —&gt; They’re right on the cited instances of GMO labeling mandates and California’s expansive carcinogen labels. But I wonder: how far would they take this if they could?\n* **Marriage Freedom** —&gt; For the availability of cousin marriage. (No statement — [NYS one of the most free here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cousin_marriage_law_in_the_United_States), though, so suck it, Cato)\n* **Mala Prohibita** —&gt; Against trans fats bans. “…the policies with the greatest potential costs to victims are racial preferences in the public sector … prostitution prohibition, and trans-fat bans.” (92) Even dropping my public health priorities — how is that not just a laugh-out-loud ranking?\n* **Travel Freedom** —&gt; Against fingerprinting for drivers licenses. I can see how this is beneficial for undocumented workers, but I’m skeptical that there’s much other benefit, and I suspect it would make it much less useful as a form of identification to everyone else. They’re also for availability of licenses for people without Social Security numbers, which seems like a more reasonable half-measure.\n* **Miscellaneous** —&gt; Against extending governors’ power to declare states of emergency (no clue how to feel on that one), and pro alcohol to go (I’ve got mixed but negative views, but probably should be a city-to-city ordinance)\n\n# The Ugly\n\n* **Land Use Policy** —&gt; Against eminent domain and use the term “blight loophole” \n   * ED can be abused, but being pro-infrastructure and against holdout problems, I’m inclined towards eminent domain powers. Not an expert on “blight” — surely has been abused, but I’m inclined to be pragmatic and say even if it has been abused in the past, it can still be a good policy in other instances, ex. abandoned properties\n* **Health Insurance** —&gt; These guys *hate* community ratings and individual mandates, literally because “they represent a large transfer of wealth from the healthy to the unhealthy.” They also dislike essential benefits mandates and mandated external review of grievances (funny timing reading this after the United Health assassination)\n   * Tough to imagine how they’ll address death spirals in insurance markets, underinsured or uninsured populations in the absence of a positive stance here. \n* **Labor Market** —&gt; Against short-term disability requirements, state minimum wage laws, policies for workers’ compensation (funding mechanisms and mandated coverage), mandated parental \n* **Lawsuits** —&gt; Support a punitive or blanket damages cap (ah, yes: *inflexible* legal systems, how considerate to create definite costs-of-doing-business for unethical proprietors), burden of proof of conduct to justify damages (seems biased against victims of harm), and count “plaintiff friendly” factors against states. (In general, Cato seems to hate lawyers)\n   * “In an efficient civil liability system, the costs that defendants have to pay are merely compensation for wrongs and not a limitation on their freedom” (49) — what a bland and uninformative position. Where does a defendant’s freedom start to be infringed upon? Rather mask-off to not even state that the cost ought to be “victim made whole, *and no more*” — at least such a position recognizes harm to the plaintiff in the first place.\n* **Gambling** —&gt; Just totally pro gambling in all sense. Highlight policies for charitable gaming, slot and video machines outside of casinos, and pari-mutuel wagering. \n   * While I think state-sanctioned gambling makes some sense given human nature, I’m not dissuaded from the view that gambling freedom derives very, very regressive profits and creates plenty of externalities that justify its regulation.\n   * To give you an idea of the kind of convenient math Cato likes: “In 2016, sparsely populated Montana raked in a whopping $400 million a year in gross revenue minus payouts, amounting to nearly $500 for every man, woman, and child.” (72-3) *In what world are those $400 million in profits being split among* [not just the men, but the women and children too?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5W2YPKH9XE)\n* **Gun Rights** —&gt; Against universal background checks, licensing or regulation of gun dealers, restriction on purchases of multiple handguns, firearms registration, locking device requirements, ammunition microstamping, training requirements for carry permits, assault weapons bans, large capacity magazine bans, and .50 caliber rifle bans. Those aren’t even my favorites:\n   * Against duty-to-retreat laws —&gt; Holy shit, this is just a blanket opposition to any reasonable standard of cause for the use of violence ! We literally discussed the inefficiencies of stand your ground law on my Economics of Law course ! Make it make sense !\n   * Against *all* the rules of the National Firearms Act —&gt; Machineguns, suppressors, short-barreled rifles, short-barreled shotguns should all be [back on the menu, boys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY4V3UUY95A)\n   * Against “design safety standards” —&gt; On the grounds that it is effectively a ban on cheap guns. The PLCAA already protects gun companies from liability for creating unsafe guns that injure their users — how much more protection from liability do they need?\n   * Against *retention of sales records* —&gt; Even more than all the above, this just convinces me that Cato would see an uptick in crimes involving deadly weapons, with no means of investigating or catching perpetrators, as a fair trade-off for these policy views. [What the fuck are police supposed to do in this world of theirs](https://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/l-p-d-libertarian-police-department)?\n* **Educational Freedom** —&gt; I don’t get the impression that Cato is very impressed by the classic assumption of positive externalities derived from public education…\n   * Pro tax credits/deductions for private schools —&gt; I am rabidly pro public school system, and look at pro-private school policies mostly as driving inequality of education. Public schools often need reform, and it doesn’t need to look like cutting the revenue that funds them.\n   * Against licensure of private schools and their teachers —&gt; Barring cases where states might make these absurdly high, why would this be beneficial to students?\n   * Against years of compulsory schooling —&gt; The children *yearn* for the mines\n   * Against homeschool notification indexes, record-keeping indexes, homeschool teacher qualifications, and homeschool standardized testing —&gt; This has “opening the door to child neglect” vibes, in my view.\n* **Tobacco Freedom** —&gt; They don’t like cigarette taxes, smoking and vaping laws in private businesses, minimum legal sale age at 21, flavored electronic cigarette bans, cigarette vending machine bans, and internet sales regulations. Public health nightmare fuel, surely we can reasonably accommodate regulations on businesses that peddle addictive substances?\n* **Mala Prohibita** —&gt; Against states equal rights amendments, state DNA databases, affirmative action laws, and bans on racial preferences in the public sector. There are reasonable conversations to be had about the costs and benefits of proactive racial policies, but I’m largely for them (I &lt;3 Justice Brennan)\n* **Travel Freedom** —&gt; Against it all… [What’s next](https://www.c-span.org/clip/road-to-the-white-house-2016/user-clip-a-licence-to-make-toast-in-your-own-damn-toaster/4713898)? Against seat belt laws, motorcycle helmet requirements, uninsured/underinsured motorist insurance coverage requirements, sobriety checkpoints, automated license plate reader data\n   * C’mon… you’re against *sobriety checkpoints?* What freedoms are we protecting here?\n* **Campaign Finance Freedom** —&gt; Just [Koch Bros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_network) views.

Maybe someday.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5i4ihu76018e1.png?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca50d14e4c9aaba53711335418a7fbb59ef4924d\n\nThey're right. Price gouging is good in those scenarios, public opinion be damned. Now Cato probably isn't so hot about addressing those who miss out on affording those resources, but it's addressable within this sub's approach. Bans on gouging or not, we would want a govt emergency service that gets necessities to those who can't obtain them in a disaster scenario.\n\nI say it's better to let prices do their thing because it leads to allocative efficiency, since suppliers will work to provide more goods to take advantage of the higher price in that scenario. Yes, that means that those who can't afford that price will not be able to buy, but we can then cover the gaps with FEMA and the like. In the opposite scenario, a price ceiling that kicks in for emergencies will lead to perhaps a more \"fair\" distribution of goods based on who gets in line first instead of who is able to pay, but it still ends with a shortage of goods. We still have to use emergency services to get food and water to people in that case, and will likely have to spend even more money on them to make up for the slack left by constrained market supply.\n\nJust some food for thought.

Pick your poison, there isn't one vendor that \"just works\".\n\nPA generally has bee good to me, but we use a limited subset of the feature sets they provide.\n\nOne thing that has me wondering what is coming with PA is not that there was a recent CVE score of 10. That was fixed somewhat quickly. What is more interesting what will become of the info that seems to show that PA has serious issues with chain of trust from hardware into the OS and onwards, and how that gets solved if it pans into being as bad as it looked. That would be a serious omission on PA's part.",

The reason the first part matters is that some vendors do not disclose internally discovered vulnerabilities and silently patch them. This means customers could be running unpatched firmware without realising they are vulnerable. Certain vendors are worse than others for that. Fortinet has a transparent disclosure policy and an aggressive PSIRT team, which leads them to discovering most of their own vulnerabilities (up to 85% is claimed). The second matters… well because of debacles like the recent PANW vulnerability.\n\nEnd of the day, make your own decision.

Hiding things definitely doesn't lead to better outcomes.\n\nThe more aggressive a vendor is in reviewing their own code for vulnerabilities, the more they will find. If they are finding the vulnerabilities, then fixing them and disclosing them, why is that bad?! I **want** all the vendors to be transparent. If vendors aren't looking at their code, they aren't finding their vulnerabilities, which means bad actors might. If they aren't disclosing the ones they do find, then it leaves their customers vulnerable because they have no idea that they need to patch it.\n\nThe real problem isn't disclosing vulnerabilities, as long as there's a patch or workaround (that works) available, It's the people who either don't patch or apply the workarounds because they're not keeping up with their cyber security, or are unable to. Getting people to patch their stuff is probably one of the biggest challenges in cyber security aside from asset management.",

In order to overcome that tendency it is not sufficient to exhibit the true; it is also necessary to expose and denounce the false. To admit that the false has any standing in court, that it ought to be handled gently because millions of morons cherish it and thousands of quacks make their livings propagating it—to admit this, as the more fatuous of the reconcilers of science and religion inevitably do, is to abandon a just cause to its enemies, cravenly and without excuse.\"\n\r\n― H.L.

I meant to say that stupid people are generally Conservative. I believe that is so obviously and universally admitted a principle that I hardly think any gentleman will deny it. Suppose any party, in addition to whatever share it may possess of the ability of the community, has nearly the whole of its stupidity, that party must, by the law of its constitution, be the stupidest party; and I do not see why honorable gentlemen should see that position as at all offensive to them, for it ensures their being always an extremely powerful party...\r\nThere is so much dense, solid force in sheer stupidity, that any body of able men with that force pressing behind them may ensure victory in many a struggle, and many a victory the Conservative party has gained through that power.\"\n\r\n― John Stuart Mill (British philosopher, economist, and liberal member of Parliament for Westminster, 1865 - 1868)",

        "title": "Peterson is hosting a function for the mega rich and libertarians, most of whom intend to implement techno-feudalism",
        "selftext": "Right wingers and the super wealthy will be gathering in London this week at the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship (ARC), a group co-founded in 2023 by Jordan Peterson and the Baroness Philippa Stroud (of the Stroud banking family). Financial backers include Paul Marshall, one of the owners of the far right GB News, and various libertarians groups and think tanks. Leaders of the Conservative Party, as well as Reform - a party stacked with prominent libertarians and ex Merrill Lynch investment bankers, as well as Elon Musk, the richest man in the world - will also be present.\n\nFigures on the advisory board of ARC include the former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott, the Tory MP Danny Kruger, the phony \"climate scientist\" Bjørn Lomborg and Tory peer and financier Helena Morrissey.\n\nPeterson will also interview Peter Thiel, the US Republican donor and Silicon Valley billionaire known for asserting that \"democracy is not compatible with freedom\". More than 50 super-wealthy Australians, including figures from rightwing thinktanks and churches, will aso be present. Among these are Bridget McKenzie, a senator for the National party, along with key figures from Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp.\n\nThere is also a strong religious influence on the ARC's direction from Peterson, various anti LGBT spokespeople, and Stroud, a committed Christian credited with shaping many of the policies of the Conservative party during the 2000s. Conservatives and far-right types from the US, UK, Australia and Europe will also attend the conference, including those with links to the new Trump administration. The House speaker, the Republican Mike Johnson, is giving the keynote address.\n\nOther Republicans due to speak include the US Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Vivek Ramaswamy – who has worked with Elon Musk on moves to radically reshape the US government – and Kevin Roberts, the president of the US Heritage Foundation, the think tank behind the “Project 2025” blueprint for Trump’s second term.\n\nThe conference has a distinctly anti-environmental, socially conservative, anti-democratic and right-libertarian theme, a form of gut-the-state libertarianism favoured by the mega-rich. Note that their goals...\n\nhttps://www.vcinfodocs.com/what-is-the-network-state\n\nhttps://www.unqualified-reservations.org/2008/11/patchwork-positive-vision-part-1/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RpPTRcz1no\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Yarvin\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Enlightenment\n\nhttps://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Neoreactionary_movement\n\n...do not seek to meaningfully alter the neoliberalism or capitalist policies favored by their liberal enemies. They seek only a purer, more stripped down form of capitalism (with various protections for oligarchs), with less labour rights, less environtal protections, less regulated business, and with third world labour augmented by a homegrown underclass, as seen in Victorian England or pre New Deal USA.\n\n(for example, in this first term, Trump removed rules protecting workers from silicosis/lung disease caused by exposure to silica dust, all of which led to a large uptake in worker deaths. He similarly rolled back workplace safety standards and inspection rules, which resulted in minority workers suffering the highest workplace fatality rates in decades, all at the behest of rich corporate owners)\n\nPeterson himself has always been awash in mega-rich dark money. He is plugged into the Koch network, and has partnered with Jeff Sandefer (to start the \"Peterson Fellowship\" at the Acton School of Business), a billionaire oilman who acquired 17 billion barrels of Australian shale oil reserves in a controversial deal, and pumped much of the profits into bankrolling conservative non-profits, in tandem with other Big Business and Big Oil groups. These non-profits include the American Phoenix Foundation, notorious for strapping hidden cameras onto operatives in order to track and illegally film politicians, essentially for the purposes of blackmail or ousting political opponents.\n\nPeterson's partner Sandefer also runs the Ed Foundation, a philanthropic tax-exempt organization that spreads cash to dozens of right wing causes. For example it dishes out about 5 million dollars in grants a year to conservative groups like the Texas Public Policy Foundation (a climate denying, Koch funded group of which Sandefer is a boardmember), Empower Texans, and AgendaWise.\n\nSandefer is also part of a network...\n\nhttps://www.texasobserver.org/revealed-the-corporations-and-billionaires-that-fund-the-texas-public-policy-foundation/\n\n...including the Koch Brothers, TXU, Exxon, Energy Future Holdings and numerous other Big Insurance, Big Tobacco, Big Energy groups, intent on privatizing education and removing all intellectual resistance to corporations (Sandefer-backed schools have consistently performed below national averages).\n\nPeterson himself constantly retweets right-wing think tanks (Heritage, Cato, TPUSA, Heartland etc), many of which are funded by the Kochs, the second largest private corporation in the US, with numerous oil and gas interests and who control the largest oil and gas fields in his hometown of Alberta, Canada.\n\nHe also promotes Koch and conservative dummy donation groups (the Leadership Institute, DonorsTrust and Donors Capital Fund etc). He also pushes right wing, libertarian groups like the Randian Atlas Society, Archbridge Institute and the Atlas Network. The Atlas Network is particularly nefarious. It receives millions from ExxonMobile, Big Tobacco (Philip Morris), Koch foundations, and has pumped millions into backing violent, far-right causes in places like Brazil and Venezuela, and millions more into social media propaganda. According to journalist Lee Fang, writing for The Intercept, the libertarian Atlas Network has \"reshaped political power in country after country, operating as an extension of U.S. foreign policy, with Atlas-affiliated think tanks receiving funding from the United States Department of State and the National Endowment for Democracy.\"\n\nPeterson himself was given about 200,000 dollars by Ezra Levant, who's a protege of the Kochs and a fellow of the Koch's Fraser Institute and the Institute for Humane Studies, both Koch funded/libertarian think tanks. Levant's far right company, Rebel Media, was also given starter money by Koch seeder companies, like the Middle East Forum, or the Horowitz Freedom Centre through the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation.\n\nPeterson's favorite \"environmentalist\", is himself not a scientist, routinely posts deliberately misleading data (http://www.realclimate.org/images//Bjorn_Lomborg_Sea_Level_Rise.png) and (https://thinkprogress.org/bjorn-lomborg-is-part-of-the-koch-network-and-cashing-in-68dab8cf68/) is himself part of the same Koch network, and in the past has received almost a million dollars (that we know of) in donations from conservative foundations. His other favorite \"climate scientists\" are crank Anthony Watts and Richard Lindzen, a widely denounced shill who worked for Big Oil, the Heartland Institute and Cato Institute, and who once shilled/lied for Big Tobacco.\n\nNote that the people Peterson loves to interview tend to be sponsored by Learn Liberty, which was launched by the Institute for Humane Studies, largely funded by Charles Koch. When he's not platforming these folk (his buddy Dave Rubin is similarly bankrolled by Learn Liberty), he also loves retweeting Maxime Bernier. Bernier was the executive vice president of the Montreal Economic Institute, a think tank funded by the libertarian Atlas Network, itself funded by Koch-affiliated groups. The MEI pushes a form of social organization simliar to feudal Japan, with little corporate feifdoms within fiefdoms, free from government oversight.\n\nPeterson also recently allied with Doug Ford, a conservative multi-millionaire who worked with various Christian groups to oppose and roll back a new Canadian school curriculum which sought to protect gay and trans kids from bullying. Ford was supported by RightNow, an anti-abortion group which rallies Christian voters and which has received support and training from the Leadership Institute, a right-wing U.S. training organization funded heavily by the Koch Brothers donor network.\n\nAnd of course Peterson recently lectured at the 42nd Annual Trilateral Commission, giving speeches to rooms full of Goldman Sachs boardmembers, central bankers, and ex Prime Ministers. The Trilateral Commission, hardly a place for underdogs (as Peterson likes to portray himself), is a supranational gathering of world power brokers, aimed at steering interzonal politics by deciding policies and economic priorities that are never subjected to the democratic approval of the nations under their gaze. In other words, a real life uber-capitalist example of the \"postmodern neo Marxist conspirators\" Peterson imagines everywhere. That the most powerful men in the world promote Peterson's brand of esoteric libertarian eschatology shouldn't be surprising. Indeed, Chomsky predicted it decades ago:\n\n\"The Trilateral Commission was concerned with trying to induce what they called \"more moderation in democracy\"—turn people back to passivity and obedience so they don't put so many constraints on state power and so on. In particular they were worried about young people. They were concerned about the institutions responsible for the indoctrination of the young (that's their phrase), meaning schools, universities, church and so on—they're not doing their job, the young are not being sufficiently indoctrinated. They're too free to pursue their own initiatives and concerns and you've got to control them better.\"\n\nThese mega rich groups, and libertarians, are attempting to seduce voters with \"anti immigration\", \"low tax\" and \"efficiency\" rhetoric. Meanwhile, in the real world, capitalism's grow-or-die imperative requires a constant influx of people to jack up production/consumption rates to avoid collapse (all low-immigration nations, like Hungary or Japan, have reversed their stances or suffered economic problems, low birth rates, brain drain etc), so to make \"low immigration\" nations work will require even starker levels of inequality.\n\nThese types also heavily promote the idea that \"government is wastefully spending\". But the debt a government incurs is always precisely the debt it removes from the civilian population (they don't understand why), and the money governments spend inexorably ends up in the real economy, where it cycles into the hands of ordinary people.\n\nThe rich have likewise convinced people that \"no tax\" and \"more efficiency\" is \"logical\", but this itself is a piece of propaganda with a very specific aim.\n\nConsider, for example, what would happen with entirely no tax. Tax, contrary to common understanding, is simply money that is immediately digitally destroyed. It is the primary way in which the money supply is prevented from expanding, so giddily ending tax inexorably leads to more inflation or an expanding underclass. The rich say this won't happen because growth increases will tricke down, but studies show us precisely where this growth goes (four out of every five dollars of wealth generated in 2017 ended up in the pockets of the richest one percent, while the poorest half of humanity got nothing. The following year, 82 percent of the wealth generated last year went to the richest one percent of the global population).\n\nThe idea of giddily \"ending waste\" is similarly silly. Every single dollar under capitalism is created as debt at interest, such that aggregate dollars in circulation are always less than aggregate debts owed. So \"waste\" (debt) is always inherently more than money or profit. Cutting wasteful spending, or even entirely abolishing government altogether, has zero effect on this fundamental contradiction. The rich only pull the \"efficiency\" card because they're looking to privatize state assets, or remove corporate tax while placing austerity measures on the public.\n\nMoreover, UN reports show that every business sector is unprofitable once environmental externalities are tabulated. In other words, all business sectors are inherently more wasteful than profitable. This is itself a fundamental thermodynamic law: the total order of a thing/commodity is always less than the total disorder/chaos/debt/entropy engendered by its creation.\n\nSo the common argument that \"government is bloated and not balanced\" misses the point that capitalism itself functions as a debt ponzi even without government! This is because virtually all money is endogenously created as debt with interest, because aggregate debts always inherently outpace aggregate money in circulation (hence you can never \"balance the economy\" in aggregate, without screwing over someone or some other nation), because most growth flows toward those with a monopoly on land and credit, because rates of return on capital outpace growth (ie no net trickle down), because banks never pump full profits into the real economy (and so the economy is worse than negative sum), because velocity is never high enough, because interest compounds (especially as the same money is lent or extended to multiple parties), and because workers are never paid in aggregate enough to purchase what they produce in aggregate (setting up inevitable cycles of overproduction and underconsumption, which help set up business cycles).\n\nGiven all this, you cannot \"end waste\" or \"balance the system\" like libertarians imagine possible. Rather, all profit constitutes (like a Monopoly boardgame) violence toward others in the system, as all profit tends to push others elsewhere off the board and into debt and so poverty (hence why 44 percent of the US lives below a living wage and why 80 percent of the planet lives on less than 10 dollars a day, 45ish percent of whom live on less than 1.75). The value of the dollar in your pocket is likewise always dependent on the global majority having none.\n\nNo JP/Musk/Conservative/fascist dream-alliance and scapegoating will solve this. Nor has it ever. Only silly people think this, because they think a global system functions like a household budget. It's also why right-libertarian policies always speed-run toward feudalism.\n\nBut the real reason people are radicalized into focusing on \"government waste\", is because the rich know that an expanding money supply leads to inflation, and that managing this money supply means removing money from the system. And to do this, one can do three things: taxation on the wealthiest, removing wealth from the poorest, or government austerity cuts. As the last two options involve the poorest suffering, rather than the richest, these are what the rich are ideologically incentivized to push, and to con people into adopting.\n\nSo \"government efficiency\" is just a pretext for conning the public into accepting the erosion of bodies that protected them, freeing up assets for privatization, and lowering corporate tax. It's gut-the-state libertarianism masquerading as \"efficiency\".\n\nThe current libertarian take-over of government (https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Libertarianism, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Enlightenment), for the process of gutting government, has always been the wet dream of oligarchs and the super rich, who recognize that government is one of the few ways ordinary people can protect themselves from exploitation. Remove government, and you've removed resistance.",

Vapid terminology and abstractions abound; of course the vaguely defined \"postmodernists\" and \"neo-Marxists\" are condemned, but no specific theorists or ideas are identified.  Apparently \"sacrifice\" is the meta-narrative that JP identifies as supporting western civilization, unaware of the irony of celebrating sacrifice for others while supporting the likes of Trump and the various oligarchs supporting his project. A lot of vague talk about the \"divine.\" Does he really imagine that sacrifice is what motivates him and the attendees at ARC, the petromillionaires and right-wing \"pundits?\"  He talks--humorless, pretentious, vapid and arrogant, as always--as if he's been given the charge of defining the underlying principles of \"western civilization,\" whatever that is.  Nothing could be less sacrifice-driven or community-oriented than the current right-wing wave, yet that is what JP would have you believe.  Utter garbage.",

My CA policies are currently set to block access to everything, excluding the CATO Named location. This works well, restricting access to internal devices and devices running the CATO client.\n\nWe want to further restrict to only corporate managed devices. So my policy needs to allow access only to devices running the CATO client and that are either managed, or where the manufacturer is VMware. \n\nI added a device filter to a policy to include devices that have a deviceOwnership set to Company OR manufacturer is VMware. It does not seems to work as an unmanaged laptop with the CATO client can still access the resource.\n\n  \nWhat am I missing?\n\n",

        "title": "Elon, Sulla, and an Ideological Suicide Note - How to fuck a Republic in three years flat (SPEEDUN, any%)",
        "selftext": "Hey everyone, just a little musing I dropped off the top of my head, while I'm mulling doing a philosophical breakdown of Continental European conservatism philosophies, parties and a \"where are they now\" to explain why Europe's conservatism is more paternalistic than the American model, and whether there's any philosophical truths or points that might make things applicable in the Anglosphere. Until then, enjoy! \n\n\\------------- \n\nSo Elon Musk, the fella determined to colonise Mars, disrupt the auto industry, and apparently solve world peace by being the richest shitposter alive, has a new hobby: quoting Roman dictators on Twitter. \n\nIn January 2025, he casually dropped this little gem into the timeline: \"“Nemo me impune lacessit” – Sulla\" \n\n\"The proscriptions of Marius forced the proscriptions of Sulla\" \n\nA few months earlier, he'd responded to some random bloke's tweet about political corruption by casually dropping references to the guy who innovated state-sanctioned murder lists like dinner party conversation starters: \n\n\"Perhaps we just need a modern day Sulla\" For most people scrolling past, these probably register as just more Musk eccentricities, alongside his promises of letting the history books know that their government was gutted open by a meme dog. \n\nBut for anyone with even a passing knowledge of Roman history, this is the equivalent of tweeting \"You know who had some interesting crowd control techniques? Pol Pot.\" What Musk is doing here isn't just the random musings of a bloke who's had too many drinks; they're revealing statements from America's Shogun (not to be confused with Douglas MacArthur, the American Shogun) about his political philosophy. Because here's the thing – Sulla wasn't just any old Roman strongman. \n\nHe was so spectacularly destructive that within a generation of his death, literally everyone in Roman politics – conservatives, progressives, and everyone in between – was falling over themselves to position themselves as the \"anti-Sulla.\" Even the ones who agreed with his policies couldn't disavow themselves fast enough from his methods. \n\nWhen the world's richest man starts channelling one of history's most notorious political butchers, we should probably pay attention. Not because Musk himself is about to march his Tesla factory workers on Washington, but because his comments normalise and mainstream some genuinely dangerous ideas about power, governance and political violence - especially when that same guy controls satellite networks, social media platforms, an ever-growing stable of companies with government contracts, or you know, said government. \n\nSo buckle up, and let's talk why he clearly doesn't understand about Sulla's legacy, and why anyone who positions themselves as a modern Sulla is essentially writing their own ideological suicide note. He's basically announcing to the world: \"I admire a political approach that was so toxic it poisoned everyone associated with it for generations.\" \n\n\\-------------------------- \n\nBefore we dive into Sulla's particular brand of fuckery, we need a bit of context about Roman politics. You can't understand why Sulla was such a catastrophe without grasping the broader political landscape he was operating in. \n\nWhy is Rome so relevant? \n\nBecause beyond the slave economy and stratified aristocracy and limited suffrage and how state-and-religion intertwined, there was one thing that defined Romans - they were legalistic and institutional. They LOVE the law and their rights and their rights afforded to their citizenship. Romans love the law and their institutions and procedural norms like Egyptians loved bureaucracy, Hellenes loved philosophy and Illyrians loved soldiery. \n\nAnd The Romans had an elaborate social hierarchy that makes modern class divisions look egalitarian: \n\nPatricians – the original aristocratic families, the old money, the ones who could trace their lineage back to Rome's founding and the overthrow of the Tarquinian kings. Primarily landowners. \n\nEquites (or Eques, or Equestrians, because they and can afford a horse when mustering for battle. And yes, their modern translation is something to the tune of \"knights\") – the business class, the Roman equivalent of the bourgeoisie. These were the entrepreneurs, merchants, tax collectors, and contractors who made their money through commerce rather than land. \n\nPlebeians – originally everyone else, though over time this group developed its own elite known as the plebeian nobility. If patricians were the lords, these were the commons – but with some very wealthy and powerful commons at the top. \n\nThese divisions weren't just academic distinctions – they structured every aspect of Roman society and created the fundamental tensions that would eventually blow the Republic apart. By the Sulla's time in the Late Republic, these old class distinctions had evolved into political factions: \n\nOptimates (\"the best men\"... according to themselves) – They favoured the Senate's authority, traditional hierarchies, and the rights of the wealthy. Think of them as the establishment, the status quo defenders, the \"we've always done it this way\" crowd. These were the conservatives who believed Rome's success came from its traditional institutions and were suspicious of change. \n\nPopulares (\"favouring the people\") – the populists of their day. They championed the power of popular assemblies over the Senate and pushed for land reform, grain subsidies, and expanding citizenship. Think of them as the ancient equivalent of modern liberal-reformists-progressives, complete with all the contradictions that entails – many of their leaders were wealthy aristocrats who LARPed as champions of the common people to advance their own careers and used popular support as a power base against their Senate rivals – but they did advocate for policies that benefited average Romans. \n\nThis wasn't a formal two-party system, but more like competing political styles and ideologies. Julius Caesar came from the populares tradition; Cato the Younger was a staunch optimate. \n\nNow, the Conflict of the Orders (494-287 BCE) was basically the original class struggle – a centuries-long tension between patricians (the aristocratic old money families) and plebeians (everyone else who wasn't a slave or foreigner). It wasn't just rich versus poor; it was about political rights, representation, and who got to have a say in governance. The patricians initially had all the power – they controlled the Senate, religious positions, and held most government offices. The plebs, despite being the vast majority of citizens, were effectively shut out of power. Through a series of strikes, protests, and threatened secessions (the plebs literally said \"fuck this\" and threatened to leave Rome and form their own city at one point), they gradually won concessions – creating their own assembly (the Plebeian Council), and eventually gaining access to all political offices. \n\nOver centuries, the plebeians organized and fought for representation, eventually winning the right to elect their own representatives, the Tribunes of the Plebs. These tribunes had the power to veto laws and protect plebeian interests. Their persons were declared sacrosanct, meaning anyone who harmed them could be killed without trial. That's how seriously Romans took this shit. \n\nOn paper, this looked like a victory for democracy and equality. In practice, Rome developed into what we'd now call an oligarchy, where a small group of wealthy families (both patrician and plebeian) dominated politics through the Senate. Not an elected body, the Senate was composed of former magistrates and served as Rome's primary governing council. \n\nThe Social Wars (91-87 BCE) were a different kettle of fish entirely. No, this wasn't Romans unfriending each other... but also technically yes. These weren't about class but about citizenship. Rome's Italian allies (socii in Latin, hence \"Social War\"), who had contributed soldiers and taxes to Rome's expansion but were denied citizenship and its benefits and got sick of being treated like second-class subjects. They wanted full Roman citizenship with all its rights and privileges. When Rome played hardball, they revolted and formed their own confederation. After several years of bloody fighting, Rome eventually granted citizenship to the Italian allies – but the conflict destabilized the Republic, it militarised domestic politics and created armies loyal to individual generals rather than the state, setting the stage for the rise of military strongmen. \n\nOh, and before Sulla, there were Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus– populares reformers and brothers who tried to redistribute public land to the poor and got brutally murdered for their troubles. Tiberius was beaten to death with chair legs by senators in 133 BCE, while Gaius committed suicide in 121 BCE to avoid capture by his opponents. Their deaths effectively proved that the Roman elite would resort to violence rather than accept reform through established channels. \n\nAnd then there was Gaius Marius, a new man (novus homo) who rose from humble origins to become Rome's greatest general. He reformed the army, opening it to the landless poor who swore loyalty to their general for land grants upon retirement rather than the state – just a lil teensy-weensy change that wouldn't do TOO much for the stability of the Republic. Only a seemingly technical change that had soldiers now looking to their commanders for future opportunity. Marius was a populares and allied with populares politicians and was a seven-time consul (unheard of!). \n\nGot all that? This was the world Sulla stepped into – class conflict, regional tensions, precedents for political violence, and an increasingly personalised military. \n\nSo what did he do? Make things worse. \n\n\\---------------------------------------- \n\nSulla began as Marius's lieutenant before becoming his bitter enemy. When in 88 BCE, he was elected consul and the Senate awarded Sulla command of the war against Mithridates (a lucrative opportunity, to avenge a king whose forces massacred thousands of Romans in Asia Minor) and was busy preparing his troops, Marius's allies used the Popular Assembly to transfer command to Marius instead. It was legal, if unprecedented. \n\nSulla's response? Instead of accepting the democratic decision, he marched his legions on Rome – breaking the sacred boundary of the city (the pomerium) that no army was supposed to cross. This wasn't just illegal; it was sacrilegious, a violation of centuries of Roman tradition, the original boundary lines of Rome ploughed by founder, king and asscended God Romulus/Quirinus. Legally, Rome existed only within the pomerium; everything beyond it was simply territory belonging to Rome. \n\nThis was the Roman equivalent of the Joint Chiefs deciding to occupy Washington because the president passed over someone for appointment. \n\nAfter driving Marius into exile, Sulla forced through legislation favourable to himself, then left to fight Mithridates. While he was away, Marius returned, seized power, and conducted a purge of Sulla's supporters. When Marius died of natural causes in 86 BCE (before Sulla could get to him), his faction remained in control under Cinna. \n\nSulla returned in 83 BCE, defeated his opponents in battle, and declared himself dictator – a temporary emergency position that had previously been limited to six months and required the Senate to renew it. Sulla made his dictatorship indefinite (\"for as long as he saw fit\"). His stated mission? To \"restore the Republic\" from populist excesses. And used it to unleash a reign of terror. \n\nThe \"proscriptions\" were Sulla's signature innovation – public lists of enemies of the state in the Forum who could be killed by anyone, with rewards for their killers, including the confiscation of the dead's property to the killers or to the state and punishments for those who helped the proscribed - by joining the list themselves. Thousands died, including about 40 senators and 1,600 equites, and their descendants were barred from public office. Estimates vary, but somewhere between 1,000 and 9,000 Romans were executed – not just political opponents but often wealthy people whose only crime was having property and wealth Sulla or his supporters wanted. \n\nSulla's victims weren't just killed; they were erased. Their descendants were barred from public office. This wasn't just political elimination but political annihilation. Sulla even had Marius's body exhumed and desecrated. That's the action of a man a few bundles short of a fasces. \n\nAll this was supposedly to \"restore the Republic\" and \"strengthen institutions.\" Sound familiar? It's the same bullshit line trotted out by every wannabe strongman from Napoleon to Putin. \n\n\\-------------- \n\nWhat made Sulla's three-year reign so catastrophic wasn't just the number of people killed, but the precedents it established: \n\nUsing the army against domestic political opponents? Sure, it's just a political tool. \n\nSystematically eliminating political enemies through state-sanctioned murder. \"Don't quote the law to men with swords\" - Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus, famed general and at this point in time, Sulla's toady.\n\nUsing confiscated property to reward supporters? Of course! \n\nTreating political opponents as enemies deserving death rather than legitimate adversaries? What could possibly go wrong? \n\nBreaking sacred constitutional boundaries whenever convenient? Don't worry, it'll buff out. \n\nDoubled the size of the Senate (packing it with his supporters), limited the power of tribunes (weakening the only officials directly representing common citizens), and codified various procedures? Easy peasy! \n\nBut his \"restoration\" was a sham. By violating the Republic's most sacred norms, Sulla destroyed the very thing he claimed to be saving. He showed ambitious generals like Caesar that the path to power ran through conquest of Rome itself, not through foreign conquest. He demonstrated that constitutional rules were just suggestions for those with enough military force. \n\nWhen Sulla voluntarily stepped down in 79 BCE (his only redeeming action, actually believing enough in the republican system to eventually resign) and died a year later of a stomach haemorrhage after a massive bender , he believed he'd saved Rome's traditional order. In reality, he'd created the blueprint for its destruction, the constitutional cancer he'd introduced metastasizing over the next three decades. He composed his own epitaph: \"No friend ever served me, and no enemy ever wronged me, whom I have not repaid in full.\"\n\nAnd yes, he did this in just THREE years. Let that sink in. Less than the official term of the elected Censors.\n\nHe managed to do more lasting damage to Rome's constitutional fabric than centuries of external enemies had managed, from Lars Porsenna of Clusium, the Veii, Brennus the Gaul who ACTUALLY invaded and temporarily seized Rome, and Hannibal himself. \n\nIn just three years, Sulla rewired Rome's political DNA and philosophy on a fundamental level. Before him, no Roman general had ever marched on Rome with legions except to throw off an occupier like Brennus – it was literally unthinkable, a religious and political taboo. After Sulla, it became a viable political strategy. Before Sulla, political violence was sporadic and generally defensive. After Sulla, state-sanctioned political murder became a tool of governance. \n\n\\------------------------- \n\nHere's where it gets interesting, and why any modern figure praising Sulla should make you double-check your boxes of democracy, soap, ballot, jury and the Rule V box.\n\nAfter Sulla's death, something remarkable happened: practically everyone in Roman politics – even his former allies and ideological bedfellows – began distancing themselves from his methods and legacy. \n\nSulla saw potential in young Pompey the Great, who earned the nickname \"the young butcher\" for his enthusiastic participation in the proscriptions. Sulla granted him extraordinary commands despite his relative inexperience. Yet what did Pompey do once Sulla was safely underground? He immediately began repositioning himself. In 70 BCE, he joined forces with Marcus Licinius Crassus to restore the powers of the tribunes that Sulla had gutted – essentially dismantling one of his mentor's signature \"reforms.\" Throughout his career, Pompey consistently presented himself as more moderate than Sulla, more inclusive, less hardline. \n\nAs for Marcus Porcius Cato (Cato the Younger), the poster boy of Roman conservatism? If anyone should have approved of Sulla's \"restore the Republic\" agenda, it should have been Cato – someone so obsessed with traditional Roman values that he deliberately wore outdated clothing and cultivated an archaic speaking style as a political statement. Yet Cato carefully avoided association with Sulla's methods. He advocated for constitutional solutions rather than Sullan-style proscriptions. His famous rigid principles never extended to endorsing the elimination of political opponents, no matter how much he disagreed with them, up to and including the soon-to-be-mentioned golden boy. \n\nAnd then there's Marcus Tullius Cicero, the great orator whose writings on republicanism would influence everyone from America's founding fathers to Edmund Burke. Cicero was technically an optimate, aligned with Sulla's conservative faction. But in his voluminous writings, Cicero repeatedly criticises Sulla's cruelty and lawlessness, even while supporting some of his institutional reforms. In his \"Pro Roscio Amerino\" speech, delivered just a few years after Sulla's death, Cicero boldly defended Sextus Roscius, a man whose father had been proscribed, explicitly condemning the corruption and injustice of the proscriptions. This is pretty much a clear a signal you could get that even conservatives understood that Sulla's methods had been morally indefensible. \n\nBut perhaps the most damning rejection came from one Gaius Julius Caesar himself – who Sulla had nearly killed during the proscriptions, saved only by the intervention of well-connected relatives and the Vestal Virgins (think Nuns that maintain a token and pact of God's own divine blessing to the state as symbolic safe haven of the citizenry). Caesar's family was connected to Marius, and the young Caesar had refused Sulla's demand to divorce his wife (whose family had opposed Sulla). He chose exile over compliance. When Caesar eventually gained power after his own civil war with Pompey, he deliberately positioned himself as the anti-Sulla. Where Sulla had been merciless, Caesar emphasised clementia (clemency) toward defeated enemies. Where Sulla had executed senators by the dozen, Caesar pardoned his opponents and even appointed them to government positions. Where Sulla had enriched himself through confiscations, Caesar implemented debt relief that benefited ordinary citizens. \n\nCaesar's famous clemency wasn't just moral posturing, but it was a strategic repudiation of the Sullan approach. Caesar understood that purges created generations of embittered enemies with legitimate grievances. His approach was to reconcile with opponents rather than eliminate them, to heal divisions rather than deepen them... while pulling leverage over his former foes via gratitude of still being alive. \n\nThe only property seizures Caesar was known for publicly were related to debt relief and paying off his campaign-related electoral debts. He gave sacrifices to thank the Vestal Virgins who'd saved him from Sulla's proscription list, recognizing how close he'd come to being one of Sulla's victims. \n\nEven when Caesar was declared dictator perpetuo (dictator for life), he carefully avoided the kind of bloody purges that had defined Sulla's reign. The message was clear: Sulla's methods were a failed experiment. Even those who shared his policy goals understood that his approach had been so toxic, so fundamentally destructive to the social fabric, that it needed to be explicitly rejected even among ideological allies. \n\nWhether you argue that Caesar was a better person than Sulla is up to you – but he was a better politician. He understood that sustainable power requires legitimacy, not just force. He grasped that even with a loyal army at his back, he needed to maintain at least the appearance of constitutional continuity and respect for tradition. Cruelty wasn't just immoral – it was strategically stupid. This lesson about the strategic value of clemency was apparently lost on later would-be strongmen. \n\nAfter Julius Caesar went to Pompey's theater for the last time and NOT enjoying the show there, his murderers claimed to be defending the Republic against tyranny. But the Roman people weren't buying it. They had experienced both Sulla's brutality and Caesar's clemency, and they overwhelmingly preferred the latter. The assassins' claim to be \"liberating\" Rome fell flat because most Romans didn't feel oppressed under Caesar – at least not compared to the chaotic violence of the preceding decades. \n\n\\---------------------- \n\nFast forward a little while later, and we arrive at a moment that perfectly illustrates how toxic was Sulla's example. \n\nThree men – Octavian (Caesar's adopted son), Marcus Antonius (Caesar's right-hand man), and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (professional political cockroach) – formed the Second Triumvirate to hunt down Caesar's killers and consolidate power. \n\nAnd the best thing they could figure out? Implement their own proscriptions. They drew up hit lists and unleashed another wave of state-sanctioned murder, starting with the execution of Cicero, whose hands and head were displayed in the Forum, as a trophy for Antonius, who Cicero criticized in his Philippics. \n\nThis decision would prove disastrous not just for their victims, but for the triumvirs' own legitimacy. One remarkable episode illustrates just how badly they fucked up. \n\nWhen the triumvirs decided to tax 1,400 wealthy women to fund their military campaigns, a woman named Hortensia – daughter of the famous orator Hortensius and from a staunchly optimate, aka conservative aristocratic family, did something unprecedented. \n\nTo appreciate how extraordinary this is, you need to grasp the social norms of Roman society. Patrician women, especially from conservative families, were expected to remain in the domestic sphere and exemplify modesty and propriety. The Forum was a male space, and women were to enter only accompanied. The rostra was for elected officials. A woman speaking publicly on political matters was simply not done. \n\nSo what did she do? She marched to the Forum with a group of elite women, pushed past the guards, stood on the rostra (the speakers' platform traditionally reserved for magistrates - males), and delivered a blistering speech condemning the triumvirs to their faces, while Cicero's hands were probably still a decorative ornament on said rostra and his skull was getting a nice sun-tan. So here was Hortensia, breaking every social convention, standing where Tribunes of the Plebes traditionally defended plebeian rights, using populist rhetoric to challenge the triumvirs' authority. \n\nIt wasn't just female empowerment (though it was certainly that in the modern consciousness) – it was a symptom of how thoroughly the triumvirs had ruptured the social contract. When conservative patrician women are adopting the tactics and language of populist rebellion, your \"restoration\" is completely fucked. It was a situation where a patrician matron had been pushed to the rhetoric of the populares and plebeians... against the Triumvirs. \n\nHortensia's protest was smoke for a potential society-wide revolt and revealed the fragility of their position – military might couldn't compensate for their fundamental lack of moral authority. Otherwise, they'd be nothing but warlords made up of ambitious opportunistic soldier-looters, no different from how they perceived barbarians, no different from the Tarquinii that were cast out and the reason Rome was a republic in the first place. \n\nMost tellingly, the triumvirs couldn't even shut her down. Despite having declared martial law and being at the height of their power in Rome, they were forced to reduce their demands. And the triumvirs themselves quickly realized their mistake - their proscriptions backfired spectacularly. Rather than consolidating their power, they created an atmosphere of terror that undermined public support. \n\nOctavian, the most politically astute of the three, began distancing himself from the proscriptions almost immediately. By the time he defeated Antony and became Augustus, father of the nation, first among equals and restorer of the \"Republic\" and establisher of the Roman Peace, he had completed a remarkable PR transformation. The man who was there when Cicero's death warrant was signed now presented himself as a restorer of peace and traditional values, cleverly pinning responsibility for the worst excesses on Antony and Lepidus. \n\nAugustus understood what Elon Musk apparently doesn't: Sulla's methods created short-term victories but long-term political liabilities. His entire imperial project was built around maintaining the forms of the Republic while changing its substance – a tacit acknowledgment that even with absolute power, openly emulating Sulla was political poison. \n\n\\--------------------------------- \n\nSo what does this ancient history lesson have to do with Elon Musk's tweets? \n\nEverything. \n\nWhen Musk casually suggests that \"perhaps we just need a modern day Sulla,\" he's not making an innocent historical reference. He's revealing either a profound misunderstanding of Sulla's historical significance or, worse, an actual endorsement of his methods. It's not governance, but state-sanctioned political terrorism in a toga. \n\nWhat's particularly ironic is that Musk's other tweet – \"The proscriptions of Marius forced the proscriptions of Sulla\" – reveals an even deeper ignorance. He's essentially regurgitating Sulla's own justification for his atrocities: that they were necessary responses to the actions of his enemies. This is exactly the logic that drives escalating cycles of political violence – \"they started it!\" is the eternal cry of the playground bully and the authoritarian alike. It's the justification that every faction use to excuse their own excesses. Forget how Nations Fail, it's how they die on a systematic, moral and societal level. \n\nWhat Musk fails to understand – or deliberately ignores – is that this logic was rejected by the Romans themselves. Caesar, who had every reason to hate Sulla and his supporters and had every inch of his equivalent power, if not even moreso, explicitly rejected this approach. He understood that cycles of retribution eventually consume everyone, that \"they made me do it\" is the weakest possible moral stance. \n\n\\-------------------- \n\nHistory is not just a collection of names and dates – it's a reservoir of human experience and governance models, a record of what works and what fails catastrophically despite values and age. When we invoke historical figures, we're not just displaying our knowledge; we're signaling our values and our understanding of how societies function. \n\nBy identifying with Sulla, Musk isn't just displaying historical ignorance – he's writing an ideological suicide note. By positioning himself as a Sulla fanboy – or cheering on others who might play that role – Musk is unwittingly predicting the failure of his own ideological project. The Romans themselves delivered the clearest verdict on Sulla's methods: they failed catastrophically. Not just morally, but practically. \n\nAt the heart of Musk's Sulla admiration – and similar thinking on parts of the right – is the Silicon Valley delusion that governance is primarily a problem of efficiency rather than legitimacy. Sulla's brutal efficiency did indeed solve some immediate problems. He eliminated his enemies, pushed through his legislative agenda, and restructured Roman institutions according to his vision. By pure efficiency metrics, his dictatorship was a success. \n\nBut his \"solutions\" failed the legitimacy test. They were perceived as so fundamentally unjust, so contrary to Roman values, that even his allies couldn't defend them. His reforms were dismantled not because they were inefficient, but because they lacked sustainable legitimacy. \n\nThis is the central delusion of modern Sulla admirers – they imagine that force and efficiency can substitute for consent and legitimacy. They fail to understand that sustainable governance requires both. \n\nIt also means that he either doesn't actually know Roman history beyond surface-level factoids, or knows the history but hasn't grasped its lessons, or understands perfectly well but is comfortable with political violence and autocracy. If Musk genuinely understands Sulla's history and still admires him, he's effectively saying: \"I think we should have a leader who marches troops on the capital, murders political opponents, confiscates their property, and dismantles democratic institutions – all while claiming to restore and preserve those institutions.\" \n\n When modern American political figures invoke Sulla – explicitly or implicitly – they're not just showing historical ignorance. They're revealing a fundamental misunderstanding of the constitutional system they claim to be defending. They're essentially saying, \"My ideas are so toxic that even my natural allies will eventually disavow them. My methods are so extreme that they'll discredit my goals. My understanding of power is so simplistic that I'll create more enemies than friends.\" \n\nFor countries like the United States that pride themselves on constitutional governance and democratic institutions with its explicit constitutional structure and separation of powers, Sulla worship is therefore an ideological suicide note. \n\nSulla-style \"solutions\" aren't just morally repugnant – they're institutionally suicidal. \n\nSo what's the takeaway from all this ancient history and billionaire tweet analysis? \n\nChoose your historical heroes carefully. They reveal more about your political values and vision than you might realize. They're telling you exactly what kind of governance they envision.\n\nAnd if you find yourself thinking \"perhaps we just need a modern day Sulla,\" do yourself a favour and crack open a history book to see how version 1.0's legacy fared.\n\n***TL:DR - MUSK IS A FUCKING MORON.*** ",

JD Vance has given interviews where he explicitly states the \"We need an American Ceasar\". To the Curtis Yarvin crowd, the Republic has outlived its usefulness, and they want to kill it. This isn't some shadowy conspiracy - they have written manifestos, given speeches and outright declared what they want to do. Trump's destruction will be widespread and long lasting. I do think he will be seen as a toxic figure in the future - but they will just use him as an example of how ineffective the institutions were to defend against him in the first place.  The reality is that the Roman Republic never fully recovered from Sulla - leading to Caeser and Civil War and an Emperor. There are parallels, but also many divergences.  Musk is overestimating his usefulness to Vance and company, but it won't matter to their objective.",

        "selftext": "I’ve been following the party since 2016, 2 years before I was able to vote. I’ve seen division growing and I’d really hate to see the end of the party. I’ve spent a great deal of time thinking of a solution and here’s where I’ve landed. \n\nThe answer is re-evaluating what libertarianism should mean in this country. If I were to isolate the values of true libertarianism, it would have to be: free markets, peace, consent, individual freedom, and natural rights. By all angles, this means becoming a big tent party, not just one narrowly defined by just paleos, minarchists, prags, and self declared ancaps; but one that accepts anybody liberal-minded under the freed market libertarian/anarchist umbrella (classical liberals, mutualists, individualists, agorists, voluntaryists, libertarian moderates/prags, ancaps, minarchists, bleeding hearts, left-market anarchists, pro gun liberals, liberty minded republicans [a dying breed], and anything in between that will act in good faith). The way I see it, moderating the message of the platform is a must. I don’t mean giving points to paleos or socialist, I mean making a point to unify the party under principles that are true to all market libertarians. \n\nThe first step is changing the party and platform to reflect language that is strictly “freedom and peace for all” rather than “liberty for me, but not for thee”. That means:\n\n1.\t⁠bringing back the anti racist plank with the addition of excluding people in support of ethonationalism, dehumanization, enforced theocracy, and feudalism from the party.\n\n2.\t⁠Adopting a mutual aid plank that supports mutual aid networks\n\n3.\t⁠Adopt a plank that identifies the free market as the peaceful exchange of goods, services, and concepts between voluntary parties via whichever contractual agreement they unanimously decide on (this clarifies that true freed markets are not just capitalism, but also open to barter, negotiation, gift economies, trade, and alternative currencies)\n\n4.\t⁠Endorse intentional communities and alternative legal systems including polycentric law, mutual arbitration systems, and dispute resolution based in restorative justice.\n\n5.\t⁠Explicitly reject corporate power and corruption.\n\n6.\t⁠Ensure the platform supports free movement and will not tolerate xenophobia or closed border policies.\n\nThese changes are what I see as necessary to prevent the party from falling to illiberal people and paleos ever again. This also opens the doors to libertarians that have long been hesitant to join the party and an opportunity for The U.S Liberal Party and others to merge with the LP.\n\nThe next step is democratizing and better federalization of how the party is run:\n\n1.\t⁠State parties need to be more compliant with the LNC.\n\n2.\t⁠Change membership rules to whoever agrees to the NAP and owns a lifetime membership while also offering membership for people who enlist for regular donations (options for monthly, weekly, or quarterly) to the party. Also National membership should automatically mean membership into their state party. This change gives more power to the individual members.\n\n3.\t⁠Absolve certain authority given to the chair to the rest of the LNC, ensuring mutual responsibility and that no chair should rule like a king (@ Angela).\n\n4.   Establish a behavioral code of conduct for the LNC and elected officials with STRICT enforcement. This must require mutual respect, talking in turn, no insults or direct attacks, no exploitation or embezzlement, honesty, and a desire to find solutions through consensus and common ground.\n\n5.\t⁠This is a big one: conjure a plan between the LP National and State Parties to create a local chapter in every county and/or major city within the next 10 years. This may mean members will have to double up responsibilities between their state and local affiliates in the short term, but the goal is to create a presence in people’s communities, which will increase recognition and participation in the party. When candidates and members have a better idea the issues their towns care about and of how to make a positive impact to their community, they have more influence in that area and can win elections. Imagine small groups of libertarians holding teach-ins, advocating direct action over local issues, holding monthly events (something like the really really free market fair comes to mind), holding charity drives, and sponsoring other local events.\n\n6.\t⁠Binding primaries for federal elections. The duopoly does this in pretty much every state and it makes sense. Registered Libertarians should have more of a say on how the party is run and who gets to represent us. You can claim it’d be too expensive to do, but we wouldn’t necessarily need state government approval, it can be done at state conventions to save money, and once we have plan #5 in the works, it’d be easier to achieve.\n\n7.\t⁠More transparency from the LNC\n\n8.\t⁠Treat libertarian media companies and think tanks as the fifth column of the LP. There is an odd hostility from some towards organizations like Reason, Cato, and others that makes zero sense to me. We’re on the same side and can achieve new heights with more cooperation. The rebooted archimedes project may solve some of this, but I would say it doesn’t go far enough.\n\nThanks for listening to my Ted talk",

            "body": "&gt; 1.\t⁠bringing back the anti racist plank with the addition of excluding people in support of ethonationalism, dehumanization, enforced theocracy, and feudalism from the party.\n\nI disagree with this, the current version of the plank is the best it has ever been and is the most pro-individualism without needing to be exclusionary.\n\n&gt; 3.\t⁠Adopt a plank that identifies the free market as the peaceful exchange of goods, services, and concepts between voluntary parties via whichever contractual agreement they unanimously decide on (this clarifies that true freed markets are not just capitalism, but also open to barter, negotiation, gift economies, trade, and alternative currencies)\n\nI don't think you understand what capitalism is, you seem to be using some weird marxist definition. Capitalism is \"the peaceful exchange of goods, services, and concepts between voluntary parties via whichever contractual agreement they unanimously decide on\"\n\n&gt; 4.\t⁠Endorse intentional communities and alternative legal systems including polycentric law, mutual arbitration systems, and dispute resolution based in restorative justice.\n\nThis is good, I would support this.\n\n&gt; 5.\t⁠Explicitly reject corporate power and corruption.\n\nThis contradicts #3. Corporations are voluntary contractual agreements. We are already in favor of getting rid of their state protections if that's what you are trying to say.\n\n&gt; 6.\t⁠Ensure the platform supports free movement and will not tolerate xenophobia or closed border policies.\n\nI disagree with the premise of this in favor of freedom of association. It's not that I think we shouldn't have free movement past government borders, I don't think governments can have borders because governments can't own property, but all property has borders and its owners do not need to allow anyone on their property. Libertarianism enables some level of xenophobia because we believe in freedom of association.\n\n&gt; to prevent the party from falling to illiberal people and paleos ever again.\n\nLibertarianism is not liberalism. These are very different, distinct concepts. Forcing libertarians to adopt liberalism is anti-libertarian.\n\n&gt; This also opens the doors to libertarians that have long been hesitant to join the party and an opportunity for The U.S Liberal Party and others to merge with the LP.\n\nWe do not want this, these people don't belong because they are *not* libertarian. It's not an issue that they are liberals, it's an issue that they are not libertarian. That is why they *left*, and that's a good thing.\n\n&gt; 1.\t⁠State parties need to be more compliant with the LNC.\n\nNo, that's not how this works for any party. The state parties are autonomos organizations, the LNC has zero say on what they do just like the RNC has zero say on what GOP Texas does.\n\n&gt; 2.\t⁠Change membership rules to whoever agrees to the NAP and owns a lifetime membership while also offering membership for people who enlist for regular donations (options for monthly, weekly, or quarterly) to the party.\n\nThis is already how this works.\n\n&gt; Also National membership should automatically mean membership into their state party. This change gives more power to the individual members.\n\nAgain, not how this works at all. These are distinct legal entities. This would kill the state parties, the states need to get their own money through their own membership.\n\n&gt; 3.\t⁠Absolve certain authority given to the chair to the rest of the LNC, ensuring mutual responsibility and that no chair should rule like a king (@ Angela).\n\nThis is already how it works and we have systems in place like the judicial committee. \n\n&gt; 4.   Establish a behavioral code of conduct for the LNC and elected officials with STRICT enforcement. \n\nA code of conduct is not a terrible idea.\n\n&gt; 5.\t⁠This is a big one: conjure a plan between the LP National and State Parties to create a local chapter in every county...\n\nThis is again, not dependent on LPNational. LPNational is not allowed to operate in the states, nor are they allowed to intervene in someone elses organization. They can *assist* those organizations by handing over their data, and helping offer resources, but anything else is outside of what they can do.\n\n&gt; 6.\t⁠Binding primaries for federal elections. The duopoly does this in pretty much every state and it makes sense. Registered Libertarians should have more of a say on how the party is run and who gets to represent us. You can claim it’d be too expensive to do, but we wouldn’t necessarily need state government approval, it can be done at state conventions to save money, and once we have plan #5 in the works, it’d be easier to achieve.\n\nI'm not sure what you are even asking for here, you already have a region representative that is elected at the national convention.\n\n&gt; 7.\t⁠More transparency from the LNC\n\nSure, I agree with this.\n\n&gt; 8.\t⁠Treat libertarian media companies and think tanks as the fifth column of the LP. There is an odd hostility from some towards organizations like Reason, Cato, and others that makes zero sense to me. We’re on the same side and can achieve new heights with more cooperation.

Maybe a fun thought experiment, but not that useful for setting actual policy in the modern era. If there's even one public (government owned and controlled) road that abuts a national border (and in reality along the US-Mexico border for example there are hundreds), migrants can just use that and avoid private property owners altogether.\n\n\"Liberal\" and \"liberalism\" are frustrating words because even just in political terminology they've changed definitions several times. In an early sense of the word as opposition to monarchy instead favoring rulers who are bound by rules, libertarianism is decisively in the liberalism camp. But obviously in the modern sense that basically means typical Democrat, libertarianism is not in that camp.",

            "body": "\\&gt; The answer is re-evaluating what libertarianism should mean in this country.\n\nNaw, man. Changing the platform again isn't the problem really. Lets be honest, most Americans have never even read our platform, let alone gotten into the weeds of ideological arguments over it. \n\nIf we tweak it, it should be for brevity and readability. \n\n\\&gt; bringing back the anti racist plank with the addition of excluding people in support of ethonationalism, dehumanization, enforced theocracy, and feudalism from the party.\n\nAll of these are already excluded by the current platform. We don't need to preach a sermon on each. \n\n\\&gt; Adopt a plank that identifies the free market \n\nAgain, this is already covered. We don't need to make walls of text to define the obvious.\n\nRemember, the first platform was three sentences long. The rest of the platform proposals suffer from the same issue. On to your other proposals!\n\n\\&gt; ⁠State parties need to be more compliant with the LNC.\n\nNo. It's a grassroots organization. The LNC runs the national convention, and only has very limited power over states with regard to that(setting delegation sizes, things like that). They don't run the state parties. The state parties run themselves, and mutually work together to set up national. You are advocating for an authoritarian, top down structure. That's not what the LP is. \n\n\\&gt; Also National membership should automatically mean membership into their state party. \n\nNo. Some people wish to support a state and not national or vice versa. That's their choice. \n\n\\&gt; Absolve certain authority given to the chair to the rest of the LNC\n\nYou're going to need to define this more than \"certain authority.\"\n\n\\&gt;Establish a behavioral code of conduct\n\nWhile decent conduct is desirable, I point out that these are inherently volunteer positions....and positions that usually require the volunteer spend a good bit of their own money. You can demand an infinite list of stuff for free, I suppose, but you will not get it. Codes of conduct generally work in settings where fiscal incentives exist to follow them, and that does not exist here. \n\n\\&gt; conjure a plan between the LP National and State Parties to create a local chapter in every county and/or major city within the next 10 years.\n\nWe don't have the volunteers. Asking existing volunteers to 'double up' is not a credible approach. Anyone already volunteering is generally already as busy as possible, as the LP has no shortage of work available. \n\nIf you wish to help out your state affiliate with a county, contact them. I'm sure they would love help. They are probably less enthused about non-volunteers who want to give a to-do list to the volunteers. \n\n\\&gt; Binding primaries for federal elections. The duopoly does this in pretty much every state and it makes sense. Registered Libertarians should have more of a say on how the party is run and who gets to represent us. You can claim it’d be too expensive to do, but we wouldn’t necessarily need state government approval, it can be done at state conventions to save money,\n\nYou are confusing primaries and conventions. A state can bind delegates. That's up to your state. If you hold a vote at conventions, which we already do, that's not a primary. Primaries do, in fact, require state participation, and this is just not available in all states. Don't like state law in this regard? Join the club. Most of us have been railing about ballot access law for decades.",

Hard to enter for newbies and earn something. On other hand has interesting science side to breed new cats. Honestly think it will be one of the longest projects, however it is hard earn there right now, HODLers very rare cats might win at the end of 2018(Gen0 cats will no appear).

Yes, I had read whitepaper and it is quite poor quality. Compare to any other decent project.\n3. Now it is just ponzi buy game with nothing to do, even pictures are stolen and their usage is illegal. Why just ask designer to make some cool drawings?\n4. Since it is rewards in ponzi, they ARE rewards in ponzi, nothing special. It didn't approve they are not scam.\n\nP.S. I had updated status from SCAM to NOT REALLY, and add whitepaper to the list.

        "selftext": "HI all,\n\nI have asked a similar question before and got a great response and insights which I appreciate (https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1jzq6bc/sase\\_vendors\\_shortlist/) so this is a more of a continuing/narrowing that post.\n\nOur focus has changed a bit as some of the comments and reflection on our business needs has led me to the fact we don't require SASE but purely SSE. So in response to that my question is do people still feel the same about their chosen vendor?\n\nThere was a lot of positives and love for Cato which is understandable, it is a brilliant platform. But I have also been lucky enough to try the Zscaler new UI console and feel the same. So given focus on SSE would you still stick with your suggestion even though SD-WAN is not in the cards?\n\nI've done my own research using my own data driven testing and research into the company and technologies (Gartner, GigaOm, Peer-spot) and have come to my own conclusion but I will leave that out to not sway results as I want opinion of practitioners who use it day to day or even consultants who sell  or support both.\n\nI'll make it simpler, if they cost the same and it was just SSE which would you go for and why, go in technical detail if you want to regarding differentiating capabilities.\n\nP.s. promise last question and opinion on this, I just find people on reddit better to give opinions of technologies like this\n\nThank you :)",

            "body": "Between the two, even though it won't likely come out as such with the Analysts you mentioned, Cato is the better solution IMO. Better overall security efficacy, better security strategy, faster to innovate and adapt to market changes (single code base) due to its architecture, full-service symmetry in all its PoPs, etc. \n\nZscaler is now fighting for its position at the SASE table, after having missed the MQ 2 years in a row. Think of what that does to divert engineering and R&amp;D efforts on the security side of the house. They operate multiple code bases and products which have a material impact on their speed of innovation and agility....and support. \n\nThat being said, the analysts are going to represent Zscaler as a more mature SSE solution in the market. I can think of 2 specific reasons why Cato's not really on anyone's SSE list:\n\n1. They sell too much SASE. Many of their customers (maybe most?) have their SD-WAN as well, so they are getting full stack SASE credit....which is why they are so high in the SASE MQ, GigaOm reports, Forest Waves, etc. True SSE, as the analysts count, does not include SD-WAN. That means Cato doesn't get SSE credit for all those SASE (which includes SSE) wins they have.\n\n2. From what I last heard, Cato didn't even register or respond to the SSE RFI/RFP from Gartner...maybe others? Hard to make the board if you're not even trying to get on it. Some think that SSE will eventually go away in favor of simply characterizing it all as SASE....another reason why Zscaler might be making so much effort and investment to get on the SASE board somewhere and why Cato probably doesn't care about spending the time and money to get on the SSE board. \n\nIn the end, SSE is a part of SASE. If you can deliver SASE, you can deliver SSE as well. If you're a leader in SASE, it would make logical sense to be an SSE leader as well...but logic doesn't always win with the analysts in the end.",

Plus, Cato's development seems to be much swifter and while maybe SSE is your use case, I like the true private backbone. Doing NAT in Cato is stupid easy and doesn't cost anything extra. You get 3 IPs by default. Yes, Zscaler may be ahead on some CASB and DLP functions (from what I recall), I wouldn't bet against Cato getting there.\n\nOh, since you had ZPA in there, Cato's east/west is superior (private backbone and not proxy based).

For starters it involves getting rid of government subsidies to fossil fuel providers that account for billions of dollars annually in corporate welfare to the most polluting of energy sources.  We also need to remove the roadblocks that are keeping us from building current models of safe, clean nuclear energy plants.  \n\nWithout government subsidies in the energy market there is price parity between energy sources instead of ridiculously cheap oil/coal.  Most folks these days prefer clean, renewable energy because of the environment and climate change so they would be more likely to vote with their pocket book and pick wind, solar, hydro, and nuclear over fossil fuels.\n\nRealistically though climate change isn't just a problem for the United States.  It's a global problem that the US isn't going to be able to solve alone.  Much of the pollution getting pumped into the earth's atmosphere now is from countries that are just going through their industrial revolution now.  I think we can solve more problems on a global level with free trade, friendship, and sharing ideas than we will with endless wars and regime change.  As a nation we've certainly made huge environmental mistakes in the past and we still continue to make some mistakes but overall the US does pretty OK.

Governors Johnson and Weld believe strongly that the first responsibility of government is to protect citizens from those who would do them harm, whether it be a foreign aggressor, a criminal — or a bad actor who harms the environment upon which we all depend.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe need to stand firm to protect our environment for our future generations, especially those designated areas of protection like our National Parks. Consistent with that responsibility, the proper role of government is to enforce reasonable environmental protections. Governor Johnson did that as Governor, and would do so as President.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nGovernor Johnson believes the Environmental Protection Agency, when focused on its true mission, plays an important role in keeping the environment and citizens safe.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nJohnson does not, however, believe the government should be engaging in social and economic engineering for the purpose of creating winners and losers in what should be a robust free market.  Preventing a polluter from harming our water or air is one thing. Having politicians in Washington, D.C., acting on behalf of high powered lobbyists, determine the future of clean energy innovation is another.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn a healthy economy that allows the market to function unimpeded, consumers, innovators, and personal choices will do more to bring about environmental protection and restoration than will government regulations driven by special interests. Too often, when Washington, D.C. gets involved, the winners are those with the political clout to write the rules of the game, and the losers are the people and businesses actually trying to innovate.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen it comes to global climate change, Johnson and Weld believe that the politicians in Washington, D.C. are having the wrong debate.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIs the climate changing? Probably so.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIs man contributing to that change? Probably so.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut the critical question is whether the politicians’ efforts to regulate, tax and manipulate the private sector are cost-effective – or effective at all. The debate should be about how we can protect our resources and environment for future generations. Governors Johnson and Weld strongly believe that the federal government should prevent future harm by focusing on regulations that protect us from real harm, rather than needlessly costing American jobs and freedom in order to pursue a political agenda.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Protect the Environment. Promote Competition. Incentivize Innovation.**\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nhttps://www.johnsonweld.com/environment",

Mark Carney and Pierre Poilievre faced the critical glare of the mega-popular Radio-Canada talk show Tout le monde en parle on Sunday in an attempt to woo francophone viewers, with the Liberal leader being pressed on his cultural awareness of the province and his Conservative rival differentiating himself against perceptions in Quebec he is a \"mini-Trump.\" Despite those moments, the CBC Poll Tracker still has Carney far ahead of his rivals in Quebec, with the Liberals poised to receive 42.4 per cent of the popular vote, the Bloc and the Conservatives jockeying behind him at 23.5 and 23.2 per cent, respectively.\n\n[Liberal operatives](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberal-oppo-csfn-1.7509217) planted 'stop the steal' buttons at conservative conference. Liberal Party says campaigners 'regrettably got carried away' with use of buttons. Two Liberal Party staffers attended last week's Canada Strong and Free Networking (CSFN) Conference where they planted buttons that used Trump-style language and highlighted division within the Conservative Party.\n\nPoilievre says [he'll use notwithstanding clause](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/poilievre-notwithstanding-clause-multiple-murders-1.7509497) to ensure multiple-murderers die in prison. Carney and Singh condemn suggested use of notwithstanding clause. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre says he'll ensure multiple-murderers die in jail by becoming the first Canadian prime minister to override Charter rights by invoking the notwithstanding clause. People convicted of first-degree murder in Canada are ineligible for parole for 25 years. A sentencing provision introduced in 2011 by the Harper Conservatives gave judges discretion to hand out consecutive, 25-year blocks of parole ineligibility in cases where an offender has committed multiple first-degree murders. It means that if someone was convicted of six murders they would not be eligible for parole for 150 years.\n\n[McGill files injunction](https://www.ctvnews.ca/montreal/article/mcgill-files-injunction-against-pro-palestinian-student-group-following-protest/) against pro-Palestinian student group following protest. McGill University has filed an application for a provisional injunction against a pro-Palestinian student group, seeking to protect the rights of students and staff from threat, obstruction and harassment, according to the university. In a message sent to students and staff last week, McGill President and Vice-Chancellor Deep Saini said that the university was seeking the injunction against Students for Palestinian Honour and Resistance (SPHR) because of the group’s involvement in classroom obstruction and vandalism during a three-day student strike from April 2 to 4.\n\n**United States:**\n\n[US officials refuse to help](https://www.firstpost.com/world/us-officials-refuse-to-help-wrongfully-deported-man-return-from-el-salvador-13879702.html) wrongfully deported man return from El Salvador. The Trump administration has acknowledged that Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant who was living in Maryland and has had a work permit since 2019, was deported in March in violation of an immigration judge’s order blocking his removal to El Salvador. U.S. officials said in court filings on Sunday that they were not obligated to help a Maryland resident get out of prison in El Salvador after he was erroneously deported, despite a Supreme Court ruling directing the government to “facilitate” his return to the United States. Attorneys for the administration of President Donald Trump said the high court’s order to “facilitate” the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia meant they should “remove any domestic obstacles that would otherwise impede the alien’s ability to return here,” not help extract him from El Salvador.\n\nUS deports [10 more alleged gang members](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/13/us-deportations-el-salvador-marco-rubio) to El Salvador, says Rubio. Secretary of state says ‘criminals’ were taken to country thanks to alliance between Trump and Nayib Bukele. The US has deported another 10 people that it alleges are gang members to El Salvador, secretary of state Marco Rubio said on Sunday, a day before that country’s president is due to visit the White House. “Last night, another 10 criminals from the MS-13 and Tren de Aragua Foreign Terrorist Organizations arrived in El Salvador,” Rubio said in an X/Twitter post.\n\nImmigration attorney: ICE prosecutors have 'no idea' of deported maekup artists' status. Since the day he left for El Salvador, there has been no communication. The court asked for an update on the case, the ICE prosecutor has no answers.

The man allegedly died after being detained in an ICE facility for months without treatment, raising alarms about systematic medical neglect amid expansion plans. A 45-year-old Ethiopian man died in U.S. immigration custody after spending months without treatment for HIV or tuberculosis, according to a new report from the Project on Government Oversight (POGO). His recent death is one of the latest to occur in the Eloy Detention Center in Arizona, a facility long flagged for detainee deaths and systemic medical neglect.\n\nTrump’s Department of Justice [deletes link to study](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/trump-doj-undocumented-migrants-crime-b2712619.html) showing undocumented immigrants commit less crime than US citizens. Administration has framed mass deportation operations as response to violent crime. The Trump administration appears to have deleted a Justice Department web page describing a study that concluded undocumented immigrants in Texas commit notably less crime than U.S. citizens, a finding that contradicts the White House’s frequent descriptions of such migrants as violent criminals. “Sometime in the last week, the DOJ removed this from its website,” immigration expert David Bier of the Cato Institute wrote on X. “Wonder why?”\n\nAn Emboldened Anti-Abortion Faction Wants Women Who Have Abortions To Face Criminal Charges. Many people involved in the abortion debate say a movement of so-called abortion abolitionists who want to punish women for having abortions is [widening.So](http://widening.So) far this year, bills introduced in at least 12 states – Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas – would allow prosecutors to charge those who have [abortions with homicide](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/us-abortion-abolitionists-criminalize-women_n_67fb1856e4b0bb4e0b77b81c). In some of those states, women could be subject to the death penalty if the bills were to become law. Most of those states already ban abortions in most cases, but the restrictions have typically penalized providers, rather than those seeking the procedure. This past week, Alabama lawmakers filed legislation that would consider abortion as murder. In Georgia last month, protesters massed at the Capitol to oppose legislation that would classify abortions from the point of fertilization as homicide. The bill had nearly two dozen Republican co-sponsors.\n\nSuspect arrested in arson fire that forced [Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro](https://apnews.com/article/josh-shapiro-arson-police-fire-pennsylvania-governor-2d17ec60c48f7d4d15123dda60c88699), family to flee residence. A man scaled an iron security fence in the middle of the night, eluded police and broke into the Pennsylvania governor’s mansion where he set a fire that left significant damage and forced Gov. Josh Shapiro, his family and guests to evacuate the building, authorities said Sunday. The man, captured later in the day, will face charges of attempted murder, terrorism, aggravated arson and aggravated assault, authorities said. Paris emphasized that the investigation is continuing. Authorities did not disclose the man’s motive, but an emotional Shapiro, who is viewed as a potential White House contender for the Democratic Party in 2028, said he is unbowed. Shapiro said that if Balmer was trying to stop him from doing his job, then he’ll work harder, and he added that Balmer will not stop him from observing his faith.\n\nDemocracy in the dark: [Ohio House secretly](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/democracy-in-the-dark-ohio-house-secretly-moves-to-eliminate-elected-coroners/ar-AA1CPsE3) moves to eliminate elected coroners. In a stunning example of government overreach conducted entirely in the shadows, the Ohio House has moved to eliminate elected coroners across the state – without a single public hearing or moment of debate, a Friday topic of discussion on the Today in Ohio podcast. Said host Chris Quinn: “This was an Ohio House move born in complete secrecy, without hearings or discussion. No one knew it was coming.” The provision, quietly inserted into the state budget instead of becoming a separate bill, would transition 86 counties from elected coroners to appointed ones, fundamentally altering a system that has existed for decades. Beyond the procedural concerns lies a substantive worry about political interference in what should be independent death investigations.\n\nThis Washington border county is desperate for Canadians. “There’s just no one around,” said a gas station owner in [Whatcom County](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/whatcom-county-washington-canadians-trump-boycotts-rcna198234), where the economy depends on residents of British Columbia remaining eager to buy American. Canadians frequently stop by Blaine, Washington, for gas, dairy and other staples that tend to be cheaper across the border. But the trade and diplomatic fight U.S. President Donald Trump has picked with America’s northern neighbor is causing more Canadians to stay home. Their boycotts have put business owners in Blaine and surrounding Whatcom County on edge, wondering how long the area’s economy can survive with fewer visitors from British Columbia to fuel it.\n\nJack Dorsey and Elon Musk would like to [‘delete all IP law’](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/13/jack-dorsey-and-elon-musk-would-like-to-delete-all-ip-law/). Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter (now X) and Square (now Block), sparked a weekend’s worth of debate around intellectual property, patents, and copyright, with a characteristically terse post declaring, “delete all IP law.” X’s current owner Elon Musk quickly replied, “I agree.” It’s not clear what exactly brought these comments on, but they come at a time when AI companies including OpenAI (which Musk co-founded, competes with, and is challenging in court) are facing numerous lawsuits alleging that they’ve violated copyright to train their models.\n\nTrump, top aides fuel [tariff confusion](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/13/trump-commerce-chief-says-not-like-a-permanent-sort-of-exemption-for-phones-computers.html) by questioning reciprocal exemptions. President Donald Trump and his top trade officials have suggested reciprocal tariff exemptions announced Saturday would be partially or completely reversed in coming weeks. “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook’ for the unfair Trade Balances, and Non Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other Countries have used against us, especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!” Trump wrote in a social media post. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also suggested that separate tariffs for electronic  products are “coming soon.”\n\nState superintendent says federal request to eliminate DEI programs appears ‘unlawful,’ [Wisconsin schools](https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2025/04/superintendent-says-federal-request-to-eliminate-dei-programs-appears-unlawful-wisconsin-schools-wont-comply) won’t comply. Wisconsin superintendent Jill Underly requested clarification from the U.S. Department of Education on the intent and legality of the directive.\n\n[Bernie gives a speech at Coachella](https://www.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/s/gTxn7hsjbG)\n\n**International:**\n\nHere is a man that expresses very well the sentiment regarding some of the media coverage these days.

China's commerce ministry has called the latest tariff exemptions a \"small step\" and has urged US President Donald Trump to \"correct mistakes and completely abolish\" the reciprocal tariffs imposed on Chinese imports.\n\n[Japan’s PM Ishiba:](https://www.fxstreet.com/news/japans-pm-ishiba-us-tariffs-have-the-potential-to-disrupt-the-world-economic-order-202504140113) US tariffs have the potential to disrupt the world economic order. Meanwhile, the country’s Finance Minister Shunichi Kato said that “the US and Japan share the view that excessive FX volatility is undesirable.” “FX rate to be determined by markets,” Kato noted further. Japan's Economy Minister Ryosei Akazawa stated that \"the FX issues will be dealt with between Finance Minister Kato and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\"\n\n[Hungarian opposition leader](https://apnews.com/article/hungary-opposition-leader-says-he-will-restore-eu-nato-alliances-10300218f9a6fa87b05d19538fe3a798) tells supporters he will restore Western alliances if he defeats Orbán. The leader of Hungary’s largest opposition party on Sunday told thousands of supporters that he would guide his country out of its international isolation if he defeats Prime Minister Viktor Orbán in elections scheduled for next year. Péter Magyar, the leader of the Respect and Freedom (Tisza) party, represents the most serious challenge to Orbán’s power since the right-wing populist leader took power in 2010. Recent polling suggests that Tisza has overtaken Orbán’s Fidesz party as Hungary struggles with a stagnating economy and has been politically sidelined in the European Union over Orbán’s policies.\n\nUK ‘will [never change food standards’](https://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe/article/3306360/uk-will-never-change-food-standards-any-trade-deal-us-says-government?module=top_story&amp;pgtype=homepage) in any trade deal with US, says government. US and Canadian practices like washing raw chicken in chlorinated water or feeding growth hormones to cattle are banned in the UK and EU. Britain will not relax its food safety standards as part of any deal to secure lower tariffs on its exports to the United States, business minister Jonathan Reynolds said on Sunday.",

        "selftext": "&gt; Every Negro leader is keenly aware, from direct and personal experience, that the segregationists make no fine distinctions between the Negro and the Jew. The irrational hatred motivating his actions is as readily turned against Catholic, Jew, Quaker, Liberal and One-Worlder, as it is against the Negro. Some have jeered at Jews with Negroes; some have bombed the homes and churches of Negroes; and in recent acts of inhuman barbarity, some have bombed your synagogues—indeed right here in Florida. Have the Nazis murdered Catholic Poles and Jews, Protestant Norwegian and Jews, the races of America fly blindly at both of us caring not at all which of us falls. There aim is to maintain through cruel segregation groups whose uses as scapegoats can facilitate their political and social rule over all people. Our common fight is against these deadly enemies of democracy, and our glory is that we are chosen to prove that courage is a characteristic of oppressed people, however cynically and brutally they are denied full equality and freedom. - Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., 1958\n\n.\n\n**INTENTION:**\n\n&gt; “Anti-Semitism is the socialism of fools.” - August Bebel, German Politician, leader of the Social Demo­crats in the late 19th century\n\nLet the intention of this be absolutely crystal clear, this is not an indictment of the Black community, it is a historic analysis of how false conceptions can be spread and reinforced through a community, both by lack of experience, cultural misunderstanding, and unfortunate encounters. Nothing discussed here is insurmountable, merely a highlighting of perceptions among some, or many, but absolutely not all black Americans. \n\nAt the end of the day Black Americans and Jewish Americans have been largely stalwart allies of one another, and have worked ceaselessly together for the efforts of Civil Rights. \n\nThese ideas presented within are a cancerous growth that has been allowed to develop in dusty corners of black culture, and needs to be opposed and spoken out against. \n\nFurthermore, Black American Antisemitism is vastly outnumbered by White Antisemitism. White people both outnumber, and have far more resources to work with in regards to radical networks in contrast to Black extremists. \n\nSo in no way is this intended to portray this as a problem of equal scope, merely discuss how it occurred.  \n\nEuropean-originated Antisemitism has it's own unique history, and would require it's own post, though understanding a basis for it would go far to explain how it influenced Black Antisemitism.\n\nAlso, the proclivities of extremist Black Americans, either in political or religious exploration, should in no way be something that hardens the heart of any person who believes in Justice for, or of the intense needs of the Black community, and our need to work together. On the contrary, this is very much about sections of the Black community needing *help*, they believe these things because of a great deal of pain, stress, or misfortune that has lead them on the hunt for scapegoats, in the same way that the Black community has received itself far too much scapegoating of it's own. This is a problem that needs to be fixed. \n\nI am going to summarize and collate much previous writing on the subject, I will drop extended reading and sources at the end. \n\n.\n\n**PRE-1920's:** \n\n&gt; \"All of us black people who lived in the neighborhood\n&gt; hated Jews, not because they exploited us but because we had been\n&gt; taught at home and in Sunday school that Jews were 'Christ killers.' To hold an attitude of antagonism or distrust toward Jews, was bred in us from childhood; it was not merely racial prejudice, it was part of our cultural heritage.\" - Richard Wright, \"Black Boy\", 1945.\n\nThe Origins of Black perceptions of Jewish people was not something that came solely out of their Migrational Collisions in the New World at the dawn of the 20th century. On the contrary Black Americans underwent centuries of exposure to and infection with European Antisemitic Folktales, LONG before there was any significant engagement between the two groups. \n\nProtestant beliefs in the 19th century were one of out-right hostility to Jewish people, with framing of them as \"Christ Killers\", and of infidels who have rejected the Christian Faith as common ones. These perceptions can be illustrated by folk songs and rhymes from the era such as:\n\n&gt; 'Bloody Christ Killer\n\n&gt; Never Trust a Jew\n\n&gt; Bloody Christ Killer\n\n&gt; What won't a Jew do?' \n\nAnother insight into Pre-20th century black opinions on Jews can be found in this 1859 quote from 'Harper's Magazine', from an interview with an escaped slave: \n\n&gt; \"I don't want to go to live with Miss Isaacs.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; \"Why don't you want to live with her? She is a good lady and will make you a\n&gt; kind mistress, and besides, you won't have any hard work to do.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; \"Ah! But Mass. . ., they tell me Miss Isaacs is a Jew; an' if the Jews kill the\n&gt; Lord and Master, what won't they do to a poor little n***er like me!\"\n\nJust the rumor that a new family was made up of Jews was enough to make this woman endanger her life and flee, knowing that the punishment could be severe, just because of her greater fear of Jews. \n\nAmong the other ideas that Black Americans absorbed through osmosis from European Protestantism were cultural and folk beliefs that painted Jews as sly and treacherous, beliefs that they were unscrupulous seekers of wealth and power, and beliefs about their position as \"Overlords\" who controlled finances and society. \n\nThis can be showcase by W.E.B. Du Bois early opinions, where he discussed Jews in very antisemitic terms, \"There is in them all that slyness, that lack of straight-forward openheartedness which goes straight against me.\", and another point in an earlier edition of \"Souls of Black Folk\", \n\n&gt; \"I have seen, in the Black Belt of Georgia, an ignorant honest Negro buy and pay\n&gt; for a farm in installments three separate times, and then in the face of law and\n&gt; decency the enterprising Russian Jew who sold it to him pocketed the money\n&gt; and deed and left the black man landless, to labor on his own land at thirty cents\n&gt; a day.\"\n\nThere were also plenty of pre-20's articles in black newspapers, where Jews are case in the light of \"money-grubber\" and as Folk that should not be trusted, such as this 1903 quote from \"Colored American\", \"...in an incredibly short time after the arrival of a Jew in any community he has nearly every family in his debt or under obligation to him.\"\n\nI feel it is suffice to say that Black Americans were not free from the cultural landscape they grew in, and cannot escape the prejudices that were shared by many Southern Whites and Protestantism at the time about Jewish peoples, and carried that with them before they ever met Jews in person.\n\n. \n\n**THE GREAT MIGRATIONS:**\n\n&gt; \"Just as society must have a scapegoat, so hatred must have a symbol. Georgia has the Negro and Harlem has the Jew.\" - James Baldwin, 1948.\n\nFollowing the growth of Jim Crow laws, and the failures of fighting them following Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), alongside with widespread violence and lynchings, over 3,400 were murdered in Lynchings from 1882-1968; more were absolutely killed before definitive records began to be kept by the Chicago Tribune in 1882, the peak year was 1892 with over 200 cases. \n\nAlmost simultaneously there was another group undergoing similar struggles; between 1880-1920 there were over 1,300 Anti-Jewish Pogroms and mass-violence events in Eastern Europe, resulting in between 70,000  to 250,000 deaths, and half a million homeless. \n\nDuring this time Southern Black Americans began en masse to move to Northern Industrial Centers such as Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, Detroit, Cleveland, and Baltimore, which only accelerated with the commencement of WWI, and the need for an increase in industrial production, at the same time that Jews also fleeing violence flooded into the same Industrial Centers hungry for work, and a respite from violence. \n\nThis lead to the first major interactions between Black Americans and Jewish Americans, with both the good and bad that can come from both closer relations, and misunderstandings and conflict. \n\nMany Jewish Newspapers did not mince words, calling Anti-Black violence in the south, just what they were, Pogroms. W.E.B. Du Bois overcoming his earlier prejudices against Jews joined with several Jews to found the NAACP. Then Jews and Black leaders worked together again and founded The Urban League. Booker T. Washington and Julius Rosenwald worked together to improve Black Education access in the South. Many Black and Jewish leaders saw clear parallels between the Jewish experience of being a people without a home, and the Black American experience of being taken out of theirs and likewise made nomadic. \n\nAt the same time, things were not so glorious and beautiful. Jewish people are not free of bias, especially group who are naturally insular and faced generational trauma, and often being immigrants with a cultural and language divide between them and Black Americans, many Jews also hungry to assimilate to reduce the threat of violence against them often adopted the racist trappings of American Culture at the time, which contributed to many Jews bigoted perceptions of Black Americans. \n\nLikewise, as previously mentioned Black Americans did not spend the last few centuries in isolation, they spent it learning the bigoted perceptions of Europeans and Americans towards Jews, and the perceptions that came with that. \n\nWhen Blacks fled to major urban centers they often had a limited support network and few resources, even if they often were still dealing with a system that was biased against their growth and ownership of property. \n\nWhen Jews fled, they often brought with them their Community religious institutions, fraternal associations, families, and resources, not to mention the small Jewish community already in the United States that was often insistent for new Jewish immigrants to assimilate as quickly as possible to reduce the potential for Antisemitism, or for Jews to be seen as \"Others\". \n\nWhich often contributed to a landlord-renter power dynamic developing between Jews who often could pull together resources to buy property and open shops, and Black Americans who often could not. This relationship, with Jews often being one of the main groups who would rent to and sell in black majority neighborhoods, led to claims that they were treating Blacks unfairly, often with additional \"Negro Taxes\" in the words of Dr. King: \n\n&gt; \"When we were working in Chicago, we had numerous rent strikes on the West Side, and it was unfortunately true that, in most instances, the persons we had to conduct these strikes against were Jewish landlords... We were living in a slum apartment owned by a Jew and a number of others, and we had to have a rent strike. We were paying $94 for four run-down, shabby rooms, and .... we discovered that whites ... were paying only $78 a month. We were paying 20 percent tax. The Negro ends up paying a color tax, and this has happened in instances where Negroes actually confronted Jews as the landlord or the storekeeper.\"\n\nIn many ways Jews were both simultaneously, \"white\" but enough on the periphery of mainstream society that criticism of Jews could be stated openly in a way that criticism of the larger White society couldn't be, how many Jews saw the criticism were in these terms, \"The Negro, filled with hidden resentment because of the inferior status forced upon him and not daring to express it in open anti-white terms, can find an outlet through his attitude toward a group that in one sense belongs to the dominant white majority, and at the same time does not completely belong, and therefore can be the target of hatred without inviting the wrath of the community as a whole… to the Negro [the Jew] becomes a symbol of general economic discrimination and injustice.”, a Rabbinical Student named Louis Silberman was quoted as saying. \n\nThis set the cultural groundwork for the period where many figures in Black Thought, and many leaders of the Civil Rights Movement, and of Black Cultural and Religious organizations would be born. Malcolm X, 1925, Martin Luther King Jr., 1929, Louis Farrakhan, 1933, John Lewis, 1940, Jesse Jackson, 1941, Al Sharpton, 1954. \n\nMost of the people who would gain prominence during or after the Civil Rights movement, grew up largely in this culture of on one hands Jews assisting with Civil Rights, and animosity between your average Jewish and Black American. \n\n.\n\n**POST-WAR &amp; THE CIVIL RIGHTS ERA:**\n\n&gt; There are Hitlers loose in America today, both in high and low places. As the tensions and bewilderment of economic broblems become more severe, history scapegoats, the Jews, will be joined by new scapegoats, the Negroes. The Hitlers will seek to divert people’s minds and turn their frustrations and anger to the helpless, to the outnumbered. Then whether the Negro and Jew shall live in peace will depend upon how firmly they resist, how effectively they reach the minds of the decent Americans to halt this deadly diversion. - Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., 1958\n\nFollowing the horrors of the WWII and the Holocaust, for a time there was nadir of Antisemitism, Jews were accelerating their assimilating following mass Jewish service during the War, and the sympathies of many people who were once casual bigots were tempered by either their experiences in, or news of the war and the horrors it brought. \n\nFor Black people though, many in the community began to see Jewish assistance as often \"patronizing\", and they wanted to feel like they had a greater ownership and control over their movement, especially as Jews began to see greater mainstream acceptance.\n\nAdditional Jewish-Black divides began forming along other areas such as Vietnam (Jews largely agreed with American goals of fighting Communism and interventionism; while Blacks often aligned with Anti-War sentiments), Affirmative Action (Jews were afraid of being sidelined with quotas, having to compete for fewer options against White applicants who they were often afraid would get preference; Blacks were largely in support of balancing out inequality), the expanding economic divide between Jews and Blacks (Jews were moving up economically; Blacks were staying stagnant), the development of Israel from Underdog to Dominate military force in the 60's-70's, with Jews largely continuing to support, while many in the Peace Movement seeing Israel as just another Western Colonial Power, and then the expansion of Antisemitic rhetoric by leaders such as Farrakhan. \n\nThese divisions heightened when Black Power and Black Separatism began to grow in popularity, especially with the Nation of Islam's meeting with George Lincoln Rockwell in 1962. Pro-Separatist radicals on the fringed would continue parroting claims that Desegregation was a \"Jewish\" plot, most likely through osmosis of these ideas from White Separatists. \n\nApart from the radical fringes though, Jews still played a significant role in the Civil Rights movement, and died alongside their Black allies, such as in the Mississippi Burning Murders, where Three social workers, two Jewish, and one Black, were murdered together in Meridian, MS. \n\nThe importance of the cooperation and work during this era should in no way be understated, it was drastically important, but more and more divisions had began forming between the communities, which was only accelerated by Jewish economic and geographic move away from black communites.\n\n.\n\n**THE MODERN ERA:**\n\n\t\n&gt; \"Once again, sons and daughters of slavery and Holocaust survivors are bound together with a shared agenda, bound by their hopes and their fears.\" - Jesse Jackson\n\nSo that now brings us to the last 30 years, with decades of greater geographic and economic separation between the groups. \n\nThe Early-90's were a very bleak time in regards to the Black-Jewish Relationship, with several major events in the communities happening all at once. \n\nIn 1991 the Crown Heights Riots occurred, after an accident where a car driven by a Hasidic man got into an accident and popped a curb and struck two Black Children, one child, Gavin Cato, died, while his Cousin Angela was severely injured, rumors spread among the neighborhood about the response of local authorities and of a Jewish ambulance service. Angry people took to the streets and damaged Jewish homes and storefronts, and attacked Jewish people on the streets, eventually leading to the murder of Yankel Rosenbaum, a Jewish student, by a mob of people reportedly heard saying, \"Kill The Jews\", and the murder a few weeks after the riots of Italian businessman Anthony Graziosi, passing through the neighborhood, who reportedly was confused for a Hasidic Jew. \n\nAt the end of the riot 1 civilian was murdered, 38 civilians were injured, 152 police officers were injured, 225 cases of robbery and burglary, 27 vehicles were destroyed, and seven stores were looted or burned, and there were nearly 130 arrests. \n\nAt the Eulogy for Gavin, Al Sharpton spoke, and made references to \"Diamond Dealers\", and a sign was raised which read, \"Hitler did not do the job\". \n\nThe same year, Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam released, \"The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews\", which claimed various conspiracy theories, such as Jews being the primary motivators behind the Transatlantic Slave Trade both in inventing and starting it, and in financing and maintaining it, that they had taken over finance, textiles, and cotton and thus built slavery to support it, started the KKK, that they have purposefully tried to take over and control Black Americans, and that Jews murdered Leo Frank as a ploy for sympathy and to work their way into Black communities, among other claims. \n\nThe Tome can politely be described as not passing any kind of historic muster, and has been repeatedly debunked, but it's popularity among fringe Black Militant elements continues, with both White and Black Nationalists having long adopted many of the books claims as talking points, and continue to support and signal boost them among Antisemitic Twitter even today. \n\nBy the mid-90's with the Million Man March, Farrakhan continued to serve a major role in organizing and speaking to the hearts of Black Americans, much to the chagrin of many in the Black Community, who continued to see his prominence as showcasing the lack of good Black leaders. \n\nBy 1998, a ADL survey found that Black Americans were one of the groups with the highest levels of Antisemitism, but that it was going down over time. \n\nFast-Forwarding to 2020, we are now in the heart of a rapid escalation in Antisemitism over the last 5 years where we have now hit a 40 year high, with every kind of Antisemitic hate crime increasing, Social Media has become incredibly more useful in it's ability to signal boost and recruit and radicalize, and we have dealt with a Major Antisemitic act of mass violence for the last two years. \n\nSo where are we now? What are the solutions? \n\nFirst of all, lets look at what happened AFTER the Crown Heights Riot... \n\n10 years after, a street fair was held, where the families of Cato and Rosenbaum exchanged symbolic gifts, and made statements about the need to heal. The City had been undertaking outreach programs for years, pointing to what Jews and Black have accomplished together. Al Sharpton has apologized and was told by Coretta Scott King, \"Sometimes you are tempted to speak to the applause of the crowd rather than the heights of the cause, and you will say cheap things to get cheap applause rather than do high things to raise the nation higher.\" \n\nThe Demographics of the neighborhood in 1991 is largely the same, with the Jewish community choosing to stay. \n\nHealing after what feels like a betrayal is hard, deeply so, and when we hear a group that we automatically assume is supposed to be an \"ally\" say or allow something hateful to happen, our automatic impulse might be to react with anger, or even violence, embrace them in the death spiral. \n\nI argue that nothing is insurmountable, EVERY single thing I mentioned is a symptom of pain, alienation, misguided rage, and have *solutions*. Addressing the pain that allows these things to grow uncontrolled is essential to salting the earth that allowed them to burst forth in the first place, and of undoing that horrors that we have done by letting nightmarish lies of bigotry and prejudice continue to be passed down to our children. \n\nI would love to open up the thread for discussion, and anyone that has anything to add to the discussion, or want to bring up some things that were missed, please bring them up. \n\n.\n\n**CITATIONS**\n\n\"From Swastika to Jim Crow\".

I appreciated your preface to this because it's so important to avoid generalizing and to not allow the discussion of this issue to lead to racist assumptions or stereotypes.",

One thing you alluded to, but deserves more expansion, in my opinion, is the effect that cold war politics, specifically around the 70's, may have played in the split. For many Jews, the United States was a dream come true, having escaped from the ahnd of the Nazis. The aftermath of the Holocaust meant that anti-semtism became less prevalent, and it had always been relatively good for Jews. The US came to represent all that was good in the world for many Jews. (This is also relavant to a split that exists beteen Israeli Jews. To simplify, both took somewhat different lesssons from the Holocaust, with Israeli Jews emphasizing the need for strength and no surrender, and American Jews emphasizing the ideals of equaility and democracy, ideals they learned from America.)  The strong US support of Israel also played into this full buy in to America. The USSR on the other hand was viewed by many Jews as being the opposite, a great evil. They knew the struggle of Jews there to maintain their way of life and most Jews would participate to some extent in the protests against the USSR on behalf of refusniks. (This also aided in the popularity of Kahane, a Jewish extremist.) The Soviet Union also was much more anti-Israel. So many Jews were extremely anti-Soviet, and supported cold war actions, like Vietnam. For black Americans, it was different. The US engaged in discrimination against them and denied them access to the American dream. The Soviets didn't really represent a threat to them, and they viewed it more positively as the Soviets didn't really dscriminate against them. They viewed a lot of the wars as unnecessary wastes of life. The Jews also were turning more right wing at this time, even if they overall voted Democratic. https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jewish-voting-record-in-u-s-presidential-elections\n\n\n\nFull disclaimer: I'm Jewish, which is why I foucused more on the Jewish community here.

It's still part of their identities through the traditions in their families, even if it's not as visible relative to their broader participation in whiteness, and even if it tends to come out at weird times and be expressed in weird ways (as this stuff always is).\n\nBut that this sort of latter-day hatred of the U.S.S.R. feels very different from and not to be confused with the proper \"Cold War\" hatred of the U.S.S.R. for being socialist - and perhaps the broader participation of these former refugee groups in postwar prosperity and cultural assimilation created the second-wave of anti-Soviet sentiment that led to the rise of John Paul II helped propel Reagan to office.\n\nAnd I wouldn't blame Black people at all for not feeling connected to that sentiment for even a little bit, any more than I would particularly expect white people whose families have been here for 400 years to really connect with *An American Tail*. If you didn't come to the U.S. in order to flee a place that was worse, and in fact might prefer to leave it for a place that would treat you better if such an option existed, why would the relative tolerance of the U.S. over the U.S.S.R. for Jews, for example, resonate with you as a concern?",

The blind irony of the self-centeredness of that position sometimes takes my breath away. The base prevalence of it across all human communities is just so huge - it is less that specific economic conditions produce racial, ethnic and religious hostility, and more that the human mind and human socialization are so geared toward racial, ethnic and religious hostility in some underlying general function that the question is not whether it exists, but how.\n\nIt's undeniable that specific circumstances in the movement of people, in the labor force, in social and economic  organization of communities shape and inform the salient divisions and the nature of this kind of hostility -- but they don't explain its presence vs. its absence.\n\nThe base assumption should be that it will exist. It should not be shocking or ignored or justified that it also exists in subaltern populations.\n\nAnd it's terrifying how eager Americans today are to embrace antisemitism specifically, because we know from even recent experience that even if we can't prevent people entirely from being tribal, and instead ought to attempt to structure incentives and responsibly administer and lead institutions to blunt the harsher effects of tribalism and create constructive and amicable engagement even among groups that see each other as different, we know that the shape of antisemitism - the how of it, the legacy, the echo of it that keeps being recapitulated through the self-reinforcing cultural cycles of the social organizations that initially produced it - is, even among prejudices, extremely dangerous to any sense of the moral good or to the aggregate degree of human suffering.",

That is also a problem. \n\nIf say the risk of violence was 1% among Antisemites, the larger pool of white antisemites will generally produce a greater amount of terrorists than the smaller pool of black antisemites. \n\nThe organized networks of White Nationalists still hold the larger threat because there are overall more of them. \n\nThey are both problems that need to be addressed, with white groups being a greater problem overall, but I chose to address this how to answer the worrying amount of Black celebrities that have boosted Antisemitic conspiracies on social media, and I am worried about the growth potential of those voices introducing radicalized messaging to people who could be influenced by it.",

In my opinion, this is overshadowed by the fact that our system of judges and juries treats African Americans worse than whites because of implicit bias. Here’s a nice (not in terms of it being racist, but rather the data being thorough) analysis of implicit bias: https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1691&amp;context=facpub\n\nThis example of systemic racism denies African Americans one of the fundamental parts of rule of law, which is that the law is to be equally enforced. This means our society doesn’t abide one of the core tenets it was established upon.\n\nThe point here about the statistics on antisemitism is that antisemitism is deeply intertwined with European and American society. We should probably also acknowledge the fact that people of all colors can and are somewhat likely to be antisemites.",

        "selftext": "Hello...reaching out to the reddit hivemind in the hopes that someone can point me in the right direction, or validate what I think I already know. Little bit of backstory...\n\nI've been using Veeam since \\~2012 and have done just about everything you can do with the base VBR suite and early versions of VAO (now VRO), but I have never run into this issue when setting up a Data Lab for automated testing. I am currently working with a customer that uses Cato for DNS on all their server VMs. Currently, they do not have a DNS entry on any of their VMs pointed to an internal DNS service/domain controller at all. All VMs point to their Cato IP for primary DNS entry, and the secondary points to 8.8.8.8. *(DNS is not my forte, and I am no Cato expert, so I can't speak to whether this is a good/recommended practice or not, but it is what they currently have in place. If this is not a proper practice, I am open to learning why and what alternative should be in place.)*\n\nIf you're familiar with how Data Labs work, then you'll see why this presents a major issue when trying to leverage VRO and the Data Lab for sandboxed DR testing. Which prompts my question: Has anyone ever had to perform sweeping DNS changes to the VMs being powered on in a Data Lab sandbox?\n\nWithout DNS pointing to something usable, we can't authenticate to run custom scripts, or to process logins to the sandboxed VMs. I can't use the the DNS options in the Data Lab networking settings becuass the are only applicable if using DHCP - all these VMs are static IP'd. So, what other ways are there to script or programmatically change DNS on the VMs? Is there any way for this to happen? Scripting it with powershell won't work because we can't authenticate to the admin$ share to run the scrip...ask me how i know. (*No...we didn't think it through before we tried.*) My gut tells me that each production VM needs to have a tertiary (*and possibly quaternary*) DNS entry poionting to the domain controller(s) we will use in the lab and then everything will 'just work', albeit with some delays while the servers figure out DNS in the lab... \n\nAre there any other options? Help me reddit hivemind, you're my only hope.\n\n",

I am using VRO and do have DNS changes that are made to work both inside the sandbox, and in the even we actually have to failover to DR.  \n\nFor the sandbox, I replicate a DC running DNS inside the sandbox.  The VM's that are replicated point to the DC since re-ip configures the primary DNS address.  \n\nLinux VM's aren't compatible with re-ip though, so I have powershell scripts that connect to the previously mentioned DC/DNS server and change the DNS entries with the correct IP's for me.  Somewhat similar situation with switching from our Prod to DR load balancer.  \n\nNot sure offhand if helpful, good luck!",

        "selftext": "\"AH LEIA KHANKEE~ YOU HAVE SO MANY BEAUTIFUL FRIENDS WANTED, HMM?\"\nJabba groans, as he tugs on Leia's chain, making her pull up from his tail, with his slimy jizz oozing out of her mouth-\n\nLeia moves her eyes to the holograms of various female wanted Rebel Alliance members, before slowly nodding her head. \n\nJabba's large eyes leer at the holographic wanted posters before he bellows, \"I WISH TO KNOW WHO THESE WOMEN ARE- ESPECIALLY THE WHITE-HAIRED LOOK-A-LIKE.\"\n\nLeia lowers and shakes her head, and begins to stroke his rehardening tail in order to please him-\n\nJabba pulls Leia close, before petting her head,\n\"PERHAPS TO JOG YOUR MEMORY, READING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED WILL DO.\"\n\nJabba then waves his hand at Leia towards his snackquarium filled with squirming gorgs, which wriggle against her grasp as she grabbed one-\n\n\"TARGETER, ALSO KNOWN AS WINTER RETRAC- AN INTELLIGENCE AGENT- FROM ALDERAAN.\"\nJabba chuckles as Leia raises a gorg to his mouth,\n\"A SECRET TWIN SISTER PERHAPS?\"\n\nLeia shakes her head as Jabba's tongue lunges out and snatches the squirming amphibian,\n\"No master- she's just a childhood friend-\"\n\n\"DO YOU RECOGNIZE ANY OF THESE OTHERS?\" Jabba retorts in a booming voice, and Leia flinches,\n\"Only Mon Mothma, the mandalorian, twi'lek and the blonde pilot-\"\n\nJabba's tail thumps against Leia's thighs, \"THE SENATOR I KNOW OF- MY, SHE HAS SEEN BETTER DAYS, HMM? PERHAPS A RETURN TO ROYAL TREATMENT WILL DO HER GOOD!\"\n\nAs Leia fetches another gorg, Jabba looks between the wanted images of the twi'lek &amp; mandalorian, \n\"SUCH BEAUTY WOULD BE WASTED ROTTING AWAY IN IMPERIAL PRISONS- THEY WOULD FAIR BETTER WITH ME, DON'T YOU AGREE?\"\n\nLeia slowly nods before she feeds her master another amphibian,\n\"Master, the Empire wouldn't let you keep such wanted prisoners-argh!\"\n\n\"DO NOT SPEAK OF MATTERS YOU KNOW NOT.\" Jabba snorts tugging her chain,\n\"THE NEW EMPEROR ONLY CARES ABOUT WHAT INFORMATION YOUR WANTED FRIENDS HAVE- THEIR FATES ARE LEFT TO ME!\"\n\nJabba then wraps his arm around Leia's waist and keeps her focused on the wanted holoposters,\n\"SO MANY TO CHOOSE FROM- BUT WHICH ONES HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON WITH YOU, KHANKEE?\"\n\nLeia thinks for a moment before licking her slimy lips, \"Winter...Evaan...Jan Ors...Cara Dune...they're all Alderaanians, like me.\"\n\nJabba squeezes Leia's stomach, \"HOW DELIGHTFULLY DELICIOUS IT WOULD BE TO HAVE SOME OF THE LAST WOMEN OF ALDERAAN IN MY NEW HAREM!\"\n\nLeia then gasps as Jabba turns her around to face him with her chain held taunt,\n\"ALL I NEED TO DO IS FIND THEM BEFORE THE EMPIRE DOES...TELL ME WHERE THEY ARE!\"\n\n\"I don't know-!\" Leia chokes out as Jabba's tail begins to squeeze her legs,\n\"I thought they all died over Endor! I have no idea where any new or secret bases are!\"\n\nJabba rips Leia's bra off and begins to pinch her nipples, making her stifle mewls before he stops,\n\"I ONCE HEARD RUMORS OF A GREAT MIGRATION OF SURVIVING ALDERAANIANS TO FIND A NEW HOMEWORLD- LED BY YOU.\"\n\nLeia bites her lip and turns her head away,\n\"We never found a new world- and- even if we did- I-I would never tell you- master.\"\n\nJabba burps some leftover gorg juices all over Leia's face and breasts before he pushes her down before him,\n\"TURN AROUND AND GET ON YOUT HANDS AND KNEES- YOUR DEFIANCE IS SWEET, BUT NOT UNBREAKABLE.\"\n\nLeia closes her eyes and moves skirts aside and gets on her hands and knees, allowing Jabba to grab her ass before his tail wraps around her waist before plunging into her tight anus-\n\nThe sudden penetration causes Leia to open her eyes and moan, and she grasps at the pillows and carpets below as Jabba thrusts his tail deeper-\n\nThis goes on for a while until as Jabba gets close to his climax, he spanks Leia and grunts,\n\"YOUR REBELLION IS FINISHED- THE EMPIRE WILL FIND AND DESTROY YOUR PEOPLE- UNLESS I FIND IT FIRST, HO-HO-HO!\"\n\nAs Leia feels herself gush with how much slimy cum Jabba fills her rear, she can't help but think about how her remaining people are without the rebellion, and if revealing the location to Jabba would be better off than extinction from the Empire...\n...\n\n\"You've all been deliberating to yourselves for far too long- give me your response.\" Winter Retrac asks in a commanding, yet delicate tone to the ruling alderaanian council within their capital building within the city of New Aldera, on New Alderaan.\n\nThrekin Horm, president of the council then grumbles, \"Your request to launch a rescue mission for the confirmed deceased Leia Organa is denied, Miss Retrac.\"\n\n\"There is no visible proof she was killed on her covert mission to Tatooine!\" Winter retorts sharply, \"In all likelihood, she's still a captive of Jabba the Hutt!\"\n\nHalla Ettyk, the justice member of the council sighs, \"Winter, the footage showing Organa as a slave girl to that Hutt is clearly fabricated- propaganda to humiliate the Rebellion- and us!\"\n\nWinter shakes her head, \"I've studied advanced fake holograms, and known Leia since childhood- it's her! Do you want to leave our last princess in the hands of the Hutts?\"\n\nlast surviving member of the council of elders Orinn Tathis stands up, \"Then you want us, all of us to know that our last symbol of hope has been reduced to a mere enslaved concubine-? I think we can all agree she is better off dead, in the eyes of our people-\"\n\n\"How dare you say that- after everything she did!\" Winter says fiercely, with some tears in her eyes-\n\n\"Enough!\" Rickert Beagle suddenly speaks, \"New Alderaan has greater concerns Retrac- such as our secrecy and temporary self-sustainability, after the Rebel Alliance was destroyed.\"\n\n As Winter turns her back on the council with a deep glare, Egyln Valmor adds, \"If you, or anyone else does leave the system to pursue that fruitless mission, you will find yourself indefinitely confined to Cantham Cellar- no matter how many good deeds you did for the Rebellion.\"\n\n\"So, how'd it go-? Oh.\" Tycho Celchu says slowly as he, Evaan and a dozen pilots and commandos stand up once Winter steps into the large hangar full of cruisers and starfighters.\n\nEvaan Verlaine, one of the lone survivors of Gold Squadron notices Winter's expression, \"They said no? Why?\"\n\n\"They believe it's a lost cause...\" Winter says in a small voice, \"They'd rather let everyone think she's dead.\"\n\n\"That's a load of Nerf fodder!\" Cara Dune, a seasoned drop trooper retorts, stepping out of the crowds of soldiers, \"Princess Leia's the reason I'm here, and probably most of us! If we ever have a shot at taking down the Empire, she's the beacon of hope we need right now!\"\n\nFormer Rebel officer Kira Lar shakes her head, \"Even if we disobey the council, where do we go? Tatooine? We don't even know where Leia is, or even if she is still alive!\"\n\nBefore anyone can reply, a hangar side door opens, and the highest-ranking Rebel leader on New Alderaan, General Rieekan steps out, \"This wouldn't be a conspiracy to free the princess, is it? The council were explicit on their answer.\"\n\nWinter steps over close to Rieekan, \"And what of it? Are you going to report this?\"\n\nRieekan offers a weary smile, \"There's another reason the council doesn't want you to cross with the Hutts- they're planning on reaching out to them- for support.\"\n\n\"You can't be serious- sir.\" Tycho says aghast, with Cara, Evaan and many others shake their heads.\n\n\"They're not happy about it either- but without the Rebellion, New Alderaan can't survive without trade long term- councilwoman Janis Pol is preparing to make a treaty deal as we speak.\" Rieekan says in a tired voice-\n\n\"I understand trading with merchants, smugglers and even pirates- but the Hutt Cartel-?!\" pilot Kasan Moor cries out amidst the uproar, \"They'll backstab us, enslave us, then sell us out to the Empire anyway!\"\n\n\"The council has anticipated that- it's why Ettyk sent undercover agents to scope out Hutt Space- at the moment, the Empire is going after every criminal syndicate besides the Hutts- it's our only shot.\" Rieekan says before he lowers his voice, \"But that's not all they've discovered.\"\n\nRieekan takes out a hologram, showing a half-dozen slave girls dancing erotically, and among them a familiar face-\n\n\"Leia!\" Evaan says almost in a shout, \"I can't believe she's alive...like this...\"\n\n\"This was recorded just days ago- on Nal Hutta.\" Rieekan says grimly, \"Jabba the Hutt's become the head of the Hutt Clans, and he still holds Organa has his prisoner- I'm sorry.\"\n\nCara suddenly gives Rieekan a back crushing hug, \"Sorry? This is wonderful! If she's on Nal Hutta, we need to bust her free- now!\"\n\nSelnia Trigg steps up, \"But we can't take on the Hutt blockade, even with all the attack cruisers in the Survivor's fleet!\"\n\nA few other murmurs of agreement go around before Winter speaks, \"We don't need a battle fleet to free Leia- we just need a plan, and I have one! Anyone who wants to get our princess back, come with me!\"\n\nHalf the group cheers in agreement, while the other half offer reluctant looks, with Rieekan stepping over to Winter, \"I won't be joining you- but if you come back with Leia- I think the council will understand.\"\n\nWinter offers him a hopeful smile before Rieekan and half of the force begins to leave the hanger, then she walks over to Tycho who bears a grim expression, \"You don't have to come with me...this is personal...\"\n\nTycho takes Winter's hands, \"Its personal to all of us. And... after I abandoned my teammates on Endor, I need this- I need to do something good.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you're with me Tycho.\" Winter squeezes Tycho's hand, \"We shall rescue Leia together- my beloved.\"\n\n\"Then- you accept my proposal?\" Tycho says noticing a ring on Winter's hand, \"I thought you said it was too soon-\"\n\nWinter gives Tycho a kiss before she walks away with a smile, \"That's because we might all die on this mission- now go prepare all the cruisers and ships we can spare, captain.\"\n\nAs Tycho prepare the larger Alderaanian ships, Winter moves to Evaan, \"I can only tell my full plan to a trusted few- you and Tycho are the only ones I-\" \n\n\"Actually...I'm going to sit this one out.\" Evaan says in a small voice, and seeing Winter's shocked expression she adds, \"Not because I'm scared- I am, but someone needs to be in charge of the defense fighters here.\"\n\nCara Dune suddenly steps over Evaan, \"Didn't you once tell me you pledged your life to Leia? Have a change of heart?\"\n\nEvaan raises her hands, \"I did- but I also made an oath- to protect our new home. If you fail, or heck, even if you succeed, there will be chaos to pay- I need to be here, prepared for anything.\"\n\nWinter steps between Cara and Evaan, \"We've all been through a lot these past months...losing the rebellion...and many friends...so I understand if some aren't ready to risk it all again.\"\n\nEvaan steps back and shrugs in her yellow jacket, \"Hey, I'm not against getting into battle, I'm still digesting the fact that the Emperor's dead, Vader replaced him, and the hot Jedi I slept with betrayed us to be his sidekick!- Oh, and if you get the chance, blow up Nal Hutta on your way out- good luck!\"\n\nAs Evaan walks away, Cara turns to Winter, \"If you want this plan of yours to go smoothly, it'd be best if both the flight and ground force leaders got an idea what we're doing- that includes me.\"\n\nWinter nods before she takes out a small white box, \"This operation requires...negotiation.\"\n\n...\n\n\"I AM MOST PLEASED YOU AGREED TO MY OFFER, SYKES.\" Jabba chuckles to the hologram of the nabooian crime leader of the Zann Consortium within his personal audience chamber, \"I'M SURE MY FORMER CONCUBINE IS PROVIDING MORE THAN TRADE DEALS, HO-HO-HO!\"\n\nSykes looks away anxiously, \"I don't know how Kateel lost her memory, but her time as 'Neelah' has certainly altered her behavior...besides that, our alliance is in motion- the Consortium's fleet is at your disposal, Lord Jabba.\"\n\n\"GOOD, GOOD!\" Jabba gurgles as he shuts the hologram off and turns to Bib Fortuna at his side, \"FETCH MY DANCERS! A CELEBRATION FOR OUR FIRST PACT SHALL COMMENCE!\"\n\nLying against Jabba's belly, Leia quietly groans, knowing she would soon be required to dance for her depraved master, and relieve the lust she brought him-\n\nBefore Bib can even leave the chamber, Jabba's hologram suddenly flickers, and a figure appears, once which catches the attention of both the Hutt and Leia- Winter Celchu.\n\nLeia sits up in fear of her childhood best friend seeing her in such a demeaning way, only to notice the hologram to be a prerecorded message, which speaks confidently, \"Jabba Desilijic Tiure, you are currently in possession of someone of great importance to us- Leia Organa.\"\n\nJabba's eyes narrow with interest and suspicion as he holds Leia's chain tight as Winter continues, \"I do not wish this to end in bloodshed, which is why I am offering you this deal: in exchange for our princess, you will receive something even more priceless: the last crown jewels of Alderaan.\"\n\nJabba, along with Bib and the rest of his current court stare at the open box of glimmering gems greedily before Winter shuts it, \"If you agree to our terms, meet us personally with the princess at the southern ridge region of Stalimur. If you turn against this deal in any way, you will pay most dearly. Be here before the start of the next solar rotation- good day.\"\n\nWinter's message ends, leaving the Nal Hutta court in silence. Leia's mind races, first with wonder, then hope- but it vanishes as she feels Jabba's belly rumble, reminding her of her place- and she already knew what her master's decision would be.\n\nWhispers fill the court before Bib leans down and murmurs to Jabba's side, \"Are you considering this proposition, my lord?\"\n\n\"OF COURSE NOT!\" Jabba snorts out, smacking Fortuna back, \"I WILL NOT GIVE UP MY FAVORITE DECORATION- AND YOU KNOW HOW I LIKE TO BARGAIN, RIGHT MY SWEET SCHUTTA?\"\n\nLeia lowers her head and nods, making the court fill with laughter as Jabba booms, \"THIS WINTER WOMAN WILL SOON LEARN HER PLACE SOON, HO-HO-HO!\"\n\nBib gets back on the dais and rubs his lekku, \"Master, are you not concerned on how this wanted fugitive managed to bypass our secure hologram network? Or what allies or weapons they might possess?\"\n\n\"ALL WILL BE DISCOVERED EVENTUALLY.\" Jabba rumbles confidently as he reaches for a paddy frog, \"AS FOR PRESSING MATTERS, FIRST, WHERE IS OUR ESTEEMED IMPERIAL LIAISON?\"\n\n\"Jixton is currently being entertained by our Harem Mistress in the outer lounge room.\" Bib hisses enviously, \"Shall I retrieve him? And assemble an elite guard, and our new fleet?\"\n\n\"LET'S KEEP JIX OUT OF THE LOOP- FOR NOW.\" Jabba chuckles deviously, \"AND BEGIN PREPARATIONS FOR OUR DEPATURE AT ONCE!\"\n\nAs the court's guards and thugs scramble to move, Jabba clutches Leia's chain as he turns his gaze to the bounty hunter booths section of his audience chamber, where his current favorite bounty hunter, Dengar, lays with Manaroo, while Bossk gropes Nima'Tar &amp; Beedo openly fucks Greeata.\n\n\"DENGAR!\" Jabba bellows, making Leia sit up against his slimy gut as the bandaged bounty hunter gets up and rushes before the Hutt, \"I'm ready for anything, boss.\"\n\n\"DID YOU FIND THE BOUNTY HUNTER I REQUESTED THE SERVICES OF?\" Jabba asks sharply, keeping his hand over the trapdoor button which Dengar stands on.\n\n\"I did, she's already here!\" Dengar gulps, \"She's around here somewhere- she's that good, right?\"\n\nJabba snorts loudly, \"SHE HAD BETTER BE, OR YOU BOTH WILL SUFFER A WORSE FATE THAN THE SARLACC PIT- NOW GO!\"\n\nAs Jabba's minions prepare to lift to Hutt out of the audience chamber, Jabba leans down and strokes Leia's shoulders, before tugging at her bra strap, \"LET'S ENJOY SOME FRESH ALONE TIME, SHALL WE?\"\n\n...\n\nJabba's personal space yacht, the Star Jewel arrives out of hyperspace outside the Tion Hegemony Outer Rim world of Stalimur, followed by a cluster of Kossak-class frigates, a couple Krayt gunships and a dozen kimogila heavy starfighters, which all descended down to the planet below.\n\nWithin the Star Jewel's private chambers, Leia stares out the wide side window at the world getting closer, for the first time in months, without her collar around her neck.\n\nLeia's entire slave outfit is gone, from arm bands to headpieces, leaving Organa truly naked- but she still wore what Jabba gives her- this time only in the form of slimy drool and semen, which coats her breasts, neck, face, stomach, backside and drips out of her womanhood as her master pulls his tail out.\n\nAs Jabba smokes from his hookah after ravishing his completely bare slave, Leia looks down at the night filled sky of Stalimur, where she finds herself drawn to small native settlements down below, especially the curious sight of dozens of candles being lit all over-\n\nJabba slimes over to his slave's side and notices her gaze, \"A CURIOUS SIGHT, IS IT NOT? DO YOU KNOW WHY THIS WORLD AND MANY IN THE TION HEGEMONY SECTOR DO THIS?\"\n\nLeia continues to stare silently as Jabba wraps his arm around her waist, \"ITS A HOLIDAY THE HUTTS KNOW VERY WELL. THE DEVOURING. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?\"\n\nJabba squeezes her waist, and Leia slowly shakes her head, making Jabba chuckle, \"I THOUGHT NOT. A CORE WORLD PRINCESS LIKE YOU KNOWS NOTHING THIS FAR OUT. ITS AN ANCIENT HOLIDAY DEDICATED TO THE LOST TIONESE COLONIES IN THE KIIRIUM REACHES- DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM?\"\n\n\"No master.\" Leia says in an empty monotone voice as she stares out, and Jabba snorts, \"HUMANS HAVE COLONIZED THE TION CLUSTER SINCE EVEN BEFORE MY KIND ROSE TO PROMINENCE- BUT THEY ONLY EXPANDED TO THE REACHES ONCE XIM THE DESPOT CREATED HIS EMPIRE- ANY GUESSES WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?\"\n\nJabba's tail pokes at Leia's slimy buttocks, \"THAT TIONESE HUMAN THOUGHT HIMSELF GREATER THAN HUTTS- SO WHEN KOSSAK THE DEVOURER BEAT HIM IN COMBAT, HIS EMPIRE FELL APART- AND EXPANDED OURS GREATLY!\"\n\nJabba's pleased expression shifts into a rare solemness, \"KOSSAK WAS PRAISED FOR CONQUERING XIM AND HIS EMPIRE- BUT WHEN THE TIONESE COLONIES CLOSE TO HUTT SPACE TRIED TO REACH OUT TO THE EARLY REPUBLIC, HE WAS FEARFUL OF AN ALLIANCE.\"\n\n\"THAT IS WHEN THE DEVOURING BEGAN- HUTT WARSHIPS BOMBARDED THE TIONESE COLONIES TO NOTHING- SPARING NO MAN, WOMAN OR CHILD- THE CLANS CELEBRATE THIS DAY, WHILE TIONESE WORLDS MOURN WHAT HAS BECOME ASH WORLDS.\" Jabba sighs.\n\nLeia's eyes momentarily flash with fearful awareness as Jabba rumbles, \"I ONLY SEE IT AS A WASTE OF VALUABLE RESOURCES- LET US HOPE YOUR FRIENDS DO NOT FORCE ME TO REPEAT IT.\"\n\nJabba's tail slips back into Leia's cunt as he chortles, \"I WILL MAKE SURE YOU GET A GOOD VIEW OF THE OUTCOME EITHER WAY, KHANKEE~\"\n\n...\n\nWinter watches as the Star Jewel lands, standing in the humid yet slightly snowy hilly ridge along with a handful of alderaanian guards, with the Corvette runner ship, The Sundered Heart landed behind them, while a thranta war cruiser, the Courage hovers overhead.\n\nAs the Star Jewel's ramp lowers, the kossak frigates hover overhead, along with the kilogila fighters and krayt gunships.\n\nJabba slimes down and heads over to Winter's company, with Leia fully dressed in her slave attire and chained at his side, while also joined by C-3PO, Dengar, Beedo, his gamorrean executioner Lomrokk and a dozen nikto and klatoonian guards.\n\nUpon getting close to Winter, Jabba licks his lips looking at her cleavage window, making his tail throb as his mind raced about seeing the rest of the intelligence agent without her white outfit-\n\nWinter meanwhile grits her teeth at the sight of Jabba holding Leia and even her former translator droid in such a barbaric way-  \n\nJabba glances over at the white sun setting in the distance, \"JUST IN TIME- DID YOU BRING THE JEWELS?\"\n\nWinter glares at Jabba before nodding and taking out the white box, and opens it up to showing the glowing gems, \"Unchain Leia and we will do a simultaneous exchange.\"\n\n\"I THINK...NOT.\" Jabba laughs, making several of the alderaanian guards raise blasters, with the Hutt's thugs doing so in turn, \"WHY SHOULD I GIVE UP MY FAVORITE SLAVE TO THOSE WHO CAN'T WIN AGAINST MY FORCES?\"\n\nWinter takes out her own blaster with one hand and points it at Jabba, \"I warned you Hutt- do the deal, or die.\"\n\nJabba only booms with laughter, holding Leia's chain taunt, \"YOUR THREATS ARE EMPTY GIRL- SURRENDER NOW, AND YOU AND YOUR FORCES WILL BE SPARED- DO YOU ACCEPT MY NEW DEAL?\"\n\nAll eyes turn to Winter, and she gives Leia a stern stare before she takes a step forward and begins to hand the box of gems- until she takes out a smoke grenade and throws it down-\n\nBlasterfire enters the area as the guards' fire at each other- in the confusion, Winter uses specialized goggles to see through the smoke- and she takes aim before firing at Jabba-\n\nBut the moment the blasterfire hits, it gets absorbed into a ray shield that forms around Jabba's form, with the Hutt laughing, \"I SEE MY NEW WRIST ENERGY SHIELD WORKS PERFECTLY- A FINE GIFT FROM MY NEW CONSORTIUM ALLIES!\"\n\nWinter grits her teeth before she notices Leia's chain isn't fully in the shield and fires at it, severing it-\n\nBefore Jabba can react, Winter rushes over and grabs Leia's hand before leading her away through the smoky battle-\n\nAs they stumble out of the smoke and down a hilly slope, Winter leads Leia towards a landspeeder while saying quickly, \"There's a ship not too far from here- you'll be safe-\"\n\nSuddenly Leia kicks Winter in the back of her knees, making her to the ground-\n\nLeia then tries to grab Winter's blaster, making her push her back in surprise, and gasp, \"What are you doing-? Has he brainwashed you-?\"\n\nLeia, with a strange look on her face tries to take Winter's blaster, only managing to knock it out of Celchu's grasp before she tries to strangle the white-haired agent with the severed chain-\n\nWinter, with some hesitation, kicks Leia in the face, making it transform- revealing her to really be shape-shifting clawdite bounty hunter Cato Parasitti, still wearing Leia's slave bikini-\n\nAs Winter continues to wrestle off the reptilian changeling, she activates her commlink and shouts into it, \"It was an imposter! Attack and capture the Hutt!\"\n\nBack at the upper ridge, the smoke clears while the battle continues, with many of the alderaanian guards being shot down by Dengar, Beedo and the cartel thugs, and before Jabba can slime his way back to the Star Jewel, a U-Wing drops down in front of him-\n\nCara Dune steps out with a heavy repeating blaster along with a dozen commandos, and they open fire, hitting a lot of the niktos in the back before the rest of Jabba's ground forces open fire-\n\nUp above, the Huttese war ships begin to open fire on the Courage, and its hangars open up, allowing nearly two dozen A-wings to fly out, led by Tycho Celchu who begins to attack the larger cartel cruisers-\n\nAs the kilogila snubfighters begin to enter dogfighting against the A-wings, the Krayt gunships dive down and blow up the U-Wing and some of the commandos, before landing and deploying the cybernetically enhanced Gank killers which begin to engage the alderaanians in battle-\n\nDespite orders, Cara Dune takes out a rocket launcher and tries to hit Jabba, only for it to bounce off the ray shield and blow up a gang of klatoonians, and Beedo, even C-3PO-\n\nBefore she can try again, the gamorrean Lomrokk slices her rocket launcher with his ax before he tackles her-\n\nWhile the Hutt war ships manage to shoot down the Courage, one of them is suddenly rammed by the hammerhead corvette, the Duchess Senna, which makes two of the warships collide together-\n\nAs the A-wings manage to shoot down many of the snubfighters, they begin to fight off the krayt gunships- before a half dozen aggressor-class destroyers arrive, led by Bossk within his ship, the Hound's Tooth-\n\nThe turbolasers from the Consortium destroyers incinerates many of the A-wings, and one of the bolts hits the end of Kasan Moor's fighter, making her crash into the bridge of the Duchess Senna-\n\nAs the Hammerhead corvette explodes on the ground below, many of the commandos are shot or sliced by the gank killers and Dengar, and Jabba raises his hands victoriously as the krayt gunships bomb the Sundered Heart, while Lomrokk shoves Cara to the ground-\n\nAbove, Tycho Celchu sees his fellow A-wings get shot down, and before he can reach any of the aggressor cruisers, Bossk tails behind him, before opening fire.\n\nWinter manages to watch just as Tycho's A-wing explodes midair before even crashing, making her cry out, \"Tycho!\"\n\nThen a stun blast hits her from behind- and Cato stands over her, holding up the discarded blaster.\n\n...\n\nWhile Jabba is slightly displeased that only a handful of alderaanians are alive to capture, he licks his lips at the lovely sight of Cara Dune and especially Winter, who is dragged back up by Cato, before the white-haired woman is tossed into the hands of a few gamorreans.\n\nCato stands next to Dengar and crosses her arms with her reptilian exposed in a less appealing manner than Leia, \"I have a holographic disguise matrix that can mimic clothes- did you really want me to wear that Huttese slave outfit so badly?\"\n\nJabba laughs as Winter begins to startle awake, \"I ONCE HAD A CLAWDITE FOR A SLAVE GIRL- IT WAS ENTERTAINING FOR A TIME, BUT SHE KEPT TRANSFORMING INTO HER HIDEOUS FORM!\"\n\nCato rolls her eyes as a guard hands her and Dengar their payment, \"Next time you hire me, I want a more dignified role.\"\n\n\"PERHAPS, BUT DON'T FORGET TO RETURN THAT ATTIRE.\" Jabba chuckles before he notices Winter silently weeping with a small amount of anger on her face, \"YOU SHOULD'VE TAKEN MY OFFER.\"\n\nWinter remains silent before Cara, being held by several gamorreans growls, \"Where's Leia-?!\"\n\nJabba grins widely as he turns around to face the Star Jewel, and one of its windows is revealed under some hull, showing the real Leia, naked and held by Bib Fortuna, who grabs at her chest and mouth.\n\nSeeing Winter's shocked reaction makes Jabba gurgle amusingly, \"PERHAPS WE CAN BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS INSIDE, HO-HO-HO!\"\n...\nAfter scavenging through the ruined alderaanian ships, the Hutt's fleet of cruisers departs the surface of Stalimur and jumps to lightspeed as the night falls.\n\nWithin the Star Jewel's main cabin and Jabba's throne room, many gather around to celebrate the Hutt's victory over the alderaanians, with Winter and Cara held in the center to be mocked-\n\nJust as Jabba finishes his lavish feast, Leia enters into the main chamber, fully dressed back into her skimpy outfit with a chain led by Tia &amp; Ghia-\n\nSeeing Leia makes Jabba's tail thump on the dais as he gurgles, \"AH, LEIA~ JOIN US, THE FUN IS ABOUT TO BEGIN!\"\n\nStill being held by gamorreans, Cara and Winter can only watch as Leia hands Jabba her chain before standing at his side, with a defeated look in her eyes, especially upon seeing her childhood friend.\n\nJabba's excitement meanwhile reaches his peak as he nudges Bib, who holds up the white box of gems, \"THESE WILL FIND A NICE PLACE IN MY TROPHY ROOM, BUT AS FOR YOU...\"\n\nCara and Winter look up as Jabba booms, \"I THINK I WILL KEEP OTHER LOVELY RARITIES FROM ALDERAAN AS WELL- BUT NOT IN SUCH DIRTY, BATTLE TORN CLOTHES- STRIP!\"\n\nThe crowds cheer and Winter glares at Jabba with hate with dried tears in her face, while Cara yells, \"I'd rather fuck a bantha you smelly fat scughole!\"\n\nThe courtiers laugh as Jabba waves his hand at both his musicians and his gamorrean guards,\n\"PERHAPS I WILL GIVE YOU THE CHANCE ONE DAY- STRIP THEM-SLOWLY!\"\n\nLeia tries to look down as Winter cries out while Cara shouts, but Jabba grabs her chin to look at the two women, and sticks his thumb in her mouth-\n\nWhile Cara punches two guards away who rip her armor off, Lomrokk begins to tear her front clothes off, making the crowds cheer, and on the other hand, Winter struggles to fight off even one gamorrean-\n\nWinter's now grimy white dress is easily torn to shreds by the gamorrean who grabs at the white-haired woman, tossing the pieces to the crowds-\n\nSoon Winter is left in her white lingerie, which makes Jabba raise his hand to stop, while the other guards hold Cara in place as Lomrokk rips the rest of her clothes off-\n\nJabba murmurs in Leia's ear, \"HOLD YOUR LOVELY FRIEND CLOSE TO ME~\"\n\nJabba then lightly pushes Leia off his dais, and as she walks over and grabs Winter, Cara is stripped completely naked, with her garments throw around-\n\nJabba enjoys a handful of Bo-toads from his snackquarium before he chortles to a naked Cara &amp; a half-naked Winter held before him, \"BEFORE I GET A GOOD TASTE, PERHAPS YOU CAN SHARE YOUR NAMES.\"\n\n\"Winter- Winter Celchu.\" Winter says in a quiet bitter voice as she clutches her ring finger while Leia holds her from behind-\n\nCara notices Jabba's lustful stare at her muscular, voluptuous body and spits at him-\n\nJabba slurps up her saliva before chuckling,\n\"SUCH SWEETNESS~ BRING HER FIRST!\"\n\nCara screams as Lomrokk holds her arms from behind and shoves her against Jabba's belly-\n\nDune's yells are muffled as Jabba shoves his tongue into her mouth, while his slimy hands grab at her large chest, and rounded backside-\n\nCara tries to bite Jabba's tongue, which is too thick, and it clogs down her throat, making the woman choke as he pinches her nipples and rear-\n\nDune desperately tries to kick Jabba's belly to no avail, but then he pulls out of her mouth, making her cough-\n\nSeeing Cara's bouncing breasts making Jabba's tail wiggle as he opens wide before engulfing her bosom into her large slimy maw-\n\nCara grits her teeth as Jabba slobbers and wraps his tongue around her heaving mounds, covering them in saliva as his hands grope her buttocks-\n\nAs Jabba enjoys the taste of the soldier's rack, his tail snakes around her muscular legs, before reaches between her thighs-\n\nCara screams and tries to keep the tail out, but two gamorreans join Lomrokk and hold her legs apart, allowing the Hutt to shove his appendage down her hairy and slightly wet snatch-\n\nWinter can only watch as Jabba's tail shoves deeper into Cara, who tries her best to not moan with her cunt and chest stimulated, but eventually she begins to orgasm, much to the delight of the crowds-\n\nWhile Jabba jams his tail roughly into the tough rebel, Tia &amp; Ghia offer themselves to the rest of the court, and they begin to blow several of them before being ganged up on-\n\nAfter some time, Jabba finishes inside Cara as she gushes for the third time, and the guards let go of the rebel as she collapses against the side of the Hutt's belly, unconscious.\n\nJabba pulls his tail out of Cara's cunt and watches slime cum spill out before he turns to Winter &amp; Leia, \"STRIP HER FOR ME LEIA~\"\n\n\"You shouldn't come.\" Leia murmurs before she slowly pulls Winter's panties off and rips her bra off, before tossing them to the crowds, who use the underwear to masturbate-\n\nJabba's tail rehardens against Cara's abs as he stares at Winter's bare body- which is nearly identical with Leia's, only with slightly larger breasts.\n\nJabba drools at the sight of her shaven womanhood and wonders if it's as tight as Leia's,\n\"BRING HER!\"\n\nAs Leia pulls Winter towards her master, she whispers in her ear, \"Please try to enjoy.\"\n\nWinter stifles a gasp as her chest mashes against Jabba's chins, as his tongue shoots out and slips into her mouth, while his hands grab at her thighs and shapely ass-\n\nSeeing Winter's discomfort, Leia reaches down and begins to finger her oldest friend, making Celchu moan into Jabba's tongue-\n\nJabba continues to slobber all over Winter's face and breasts as Leia fingers the naked woman, until she gasps out and squirts-\n\nAs Winter slumps against Jabba's belly, the Hutt chuckles to Leia, \"REMOVE YOUR SKIRTS~\"\n\nKnowing what he wants, Leia quickly removes skirts and top, before she allows Jabba to pick her up and his tongue dancing with hers before it descends and goes between her chest, then down to her wet womanhood-\n\nAs Jabba holds Leia up and begins to eat her out, his tail squirms over to a still recovering Winter and makes its way between her legs-\n\nWinter screams into Jabba's belly as his tail penetrates her, being bigger than Tycho or any last lovers, and she finds herself stuck as Leia's legs hug her against the Hutt-\n\n\"YES MASTER~!\" Leia cries out as she orgasms to Jabba's tongue, while Winter, in her grief and shock, lays numbly on her front, ignoring the jeers and catcalls as the large tail fucks her cunt and makes her forget the pain-\n\nIt doesn't take long for Winter to squirt again and again for her Hutt enslaver, and after what feels like hours, Jabba finally explodes, filling her womb full of his vile seed-\n\nAs Winter lays motionless and moans, Leia slumps down Jabba's front exhausted, and watches hazily as the Hutt's tail continues pumps into her best friend-\n\nJabba sleepily sighs as he pops his tail out of Winter's snatch and rubs it all over her smooth buttocks, while feeling Leia &amp; Cara's slumbering forms against his hide makes the Hutt soon drift off along his favorite and newly enslaved alderaanians...\n————————————————————————",

        "title": "How the Koch network billionaires attacked protestors, bought politicians to take over the Republican Party, destroyed North Carolina, and tricked the “middle third”",
        "selftext": "\nHi everyone,\nHere is my final post (4/4) summarizing Dark Money by Jane Mayer - at the end, she shows that the fight for America is down to the “middle third” of Americans who have been turned by billionaires away from their desires to have a clean environment and health and high standards of living, as well as political and religious freedom and peace and security. Hopefully, they can be won back. \n\n———\n\nWhen Koch donors met for their January 2011 summit, protestors swarmed the hitherto secret meeting for the first time. [342] A ragtag assortment of protestors waved signs saying “Koch Kills!” And “Uncloak the Kochs!” with 25 arrested and Politico reporter Kenneth Vogel threatened with arrest as well unless he left the premises immediately. [342] A golf partner said David Koch “spumed and sputtered” about The New Yorker and others scrutinizing the brothers, blaming the media for death threats and forcing his family to hire personal bodyguards. [343] \n\nThey hired a new team of public relations advisers specializing in aggressive tactics, such as Michael Goldfarb, a Republican political operative, hired to improve the company’s image. [343] He founded an online publication called The Washington Free Beacon to practice “combat journalism” against “liberal gasbags” with the motto “Do unto them”. [343] One conservative journalist told The New Republic, “I mean no disrespect, and I like him personally, but he is the single shadiest person on the right”. [345] \n\nPhilip Ellender, co-president of Koch Companies Public Sector, who oversaw the company’s lobbying and public relations operations in Washington and who had a reputation, as Politico put it, for using “tactics that helped cement the view that the Kochs play rough”, launched a website called KochFacts that waged ad hominem attacks, questioning the professionalism and integrity of reporters critical of the Kochs, ranging from The New York Times to Politico. [344] \n\n### Jane Mayer’s article for The New Yorker about the Kochs, “Covert Operations: The billionaire brothers who are waging a war against Obama”, revealed in depth for the first time how the publicity-shy Koch brothers had stealthily leveraged their vast fortune to exert outsized influence over American politics and how their environmental and safety record was woefully at odds with their burnished images as selfless philanthropists. [345] \n\n### After David Koch via The Daily Beast called the article “hateful”, “ludicrous” and “plain wrong” without specific complaints and requiring no corrections, [345] a well-informed source told Mayer that the Kochs were trying to counteract the story by undermining her and digging for “dirt, dirt, dirt. If they couldn’t find it, they’d create it”. [346]\n\nA private investigative firm was retained - Vigilant Resources International, whose founder and chairman, Howard Safir, had been NYC’s police commissioner under former mayor Rudy Giuliani, though they would neither “confirm nor deny” their work on her. [346] Although potentially ruinous claims of plagiarism were “alleged” by Jonathan Strong, a reporter for The Daily Caller [347], when the alleged reporters who were supposedly victims of Mayer refuted the allegations, The Daily Caller dropped the story. [347-349] \n\nInstead, Keith Kelly wrote a followup story entitled “Smear Disappears”, asking “Who is behind the apparently concerted campaign to smear the New Yorker’s Jane Mayer? The story is dead but the person or persons behind the allegations remains a shadowy mystery”. [349] The plagiarism play had been timed to try to stop The New Yorker from nominating the Koch story for a National Magazine Award, according to the New York Post. [349] Koch Industries’ general counsel, Holden, sent an unusual letter to the board of the American Society of Magazine Editors, trying to stop it from picking Mayer’s story for the prize, which it didn’t win anyway. [349]\n\n### For 2012, Obama said, “[I]nequality distorts our democracy. It gives an outsized voice to the few who can afford high-priced lobbyists and unlimited campaign contributions, and it runs the risk of selling out our democracy to the highest bidder” [394] but faced with the prospect of $660 million of outside spending against him, he too began encouraging supporters to give to his super PAC, Priorities USA [395] and went after the Republican Party with Romney with anti-finance ads, [396] calling him a “job destroyer” and his firm “a vampire” despite protests of unfairness from finance donors. [396-397] \n\n&gt; Mother Jones revealed a secret recording made by a member of waitstaff at a high end fundraiser that May for Romney, where he assured his wealthy supporters that he didn’t care about the “47% of the people who will vote for the president no matter what” because “I’ll never convince them they should take personal responsibility for their lives” since they were people “dependent upon government, who believe they are victims, who believe government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe they are entitled to health care, food, to housing, you name it. … people who pay no income tax”. [398]  \n\nDespite losing the presidential election, the Republicans cemented their control over the state legislatures with the redrawing of the boundaries of congressional districts so that despite getting fewer votes than Democrats, they won more congressional seats in states as well as holding onto the House of Representatives, despite a bigger 2012 turnout nationwide for Democrats. [410] \n\nThe Republican State Leadership Committee (RSLC), the group used to run REDMAP, engaged their offshoot dark-money group called the State Government Leadership Foundation, a 501(c)(4) that could hide the identities of donors, [412] to use a program called Maptitude containing population details of every neighborhood, including the residents’ racial makeup, starting in North Carolina, to redistrict boundaries. [412-413] \n\n### Republican legislators overseeing the redistricting held public hearings across the state but the SGLF never read any of those transcripts. [413] Their new map reduced the number of congressional seats that Democrats could win by packing minority voters into three districts with an already high concentration of African-American voters that they could “pack” together to lessen their effect on surrounding areas with more white and Republican voters. [413] \n\n### Progressive groups sued, alleging the maps violated the Voting Rights Act, but after $2.3 million from the Koch’s AFP, Gillespie’s RSLC and Pope’s Variety Wholesalers poured in to support the reelection of one of the Republican judges, the state supreme court upheld the Republican-led redistricting plan. [413-414] By channeling donors’ money to largely overlooked state and local races, Republicans succeeded in not only advancing their political agenda but in wiping out a generation of lower-level Democratic office holders who could rise in the future. [414] \n### The new Republican North Carolina general assembly enacted policies incubated by their think tanks - they slashed taxes on corporations and the wealthy while cutting benefits and services for the middle class and the poor, gutted environmental programs, sharply limited women’s access to abortion, backed a constitutional ban on gay marriage, and legalized concealed guns in bars and on playgrounds and school campuses as well as cumbersome new bureaucratic barriers to voting. [417] Specifically, it eliminated the earned income tax credit for low income workers and cut unemployment benefits so low that the state was not eligible for the $780 million in emergency federal unemployment aid it would have otherwise qualified for. [418] As a result, North Carolina, with the country’s 5th highest unemployment rate, soon offered the lowest unemployment benefits in the country. [418] \n\nAt the same time, it repealed the estate tax, even though existing law exempted the first $5.25 million of inheritance from taxation and the change affected only 23 estates, which cost the state $300 million in its first 5 years. [418] The state rejected the free expanded Medicaid coverage for the needy that it was eligible for under the ACA, denying free health care for 500,000 uninsured low-income residents. [418] \n\n### To make up for the funds lost in tax cuts, the legislature turned to raid its celebrated public education system - the one institution that had distinguished North Carolina from many southern states, eliminating teachers’ assistants, reducing teacher pay from 21st highest to 46th, and abolishing incentives for teachers to earn higher degrees, despite the overwhelming preference of voters to avoid these cuts by extending a temporary one-penny sales tax to sustain educational funding. [419] North Carolina’s esteemed state university system was next up for severe cuts by the Republican majority legislature, which was projected to cause tuition hikes, faculty layoffs, and fewer scholarships, even though the state’s constitution required that higher education be made “as free as practical” to all residents. [419] \n\nEmployees of the John William Pope Center for Higher Education Policy accused the university of becoming a “niche for radicals”, its public funding “a boondoggle” and demanded the legislature “starve the beast”. [419] Instead, Pope offered to privately fund academic programs in subjects he favored, like Western civilization and free-market economics. [420] Pope gifted $500,000 to North Carolina State University, to fund lectures by conservatives. [420] \n\n&gt; Cat Warren, an English professor at North Carolina State, said “It’s sad and blatant. [Pope] succeeds in getting higher education defunded, and then uses those cutbacks as a way to increase leverage and influence over course content”. [420] \n\nThe Republican state senate passed a bill requiring North Carolina’s high school students to study conservative principles that stressed “the constitutional limitations on government power to tax and spend” as part of American history in order to graduate in 2015. [420]\n\n### In the fall of 2013, an obscure Republican freshman congressman from one of North Carolina’s newly gerrymandered districts would set in motion the shutdown of the federal government. [428] Gerrymandering had removed so many Democrats from the rural, mountainous 11th Congressional district that conservative Democrat Heath Shuler retired rather than waste time and money on a hopeless race, all but handing over the seat to Mark Meadows, a restaurant owner and Sunday-school Bible teacher, in 2012. [428] \n\n### After only 8 months in office, Meadows made national headlines by sending an open letter to the Republican leaders of the House demanding they use the “power of the purse” to kill the ACA. [428-429] The ACA had already been upheld by the Supreme Court and affirmed when voters reelected Obama in 2012. [429]\n\nBut Meadows argued that Republicans should sabotage the ACA by refusing to appropriate any funds for its implementation. [429] If they didn’t get their way, they would shut down the government. [429] By fall, Meadows had succeeded in getting more than 79 Republicans to sign onto this plan, forcing Speaker of the House John Boehner, who opposed the radical measure, to accede to their demands. [429] \n\n### Meadows was hailed by his local Tea Party group as “our poster boy” and by CNN as the “architect” of the 2013 shutdown. [429] When the radicals refused to back down, bringing virtually the entire federal government to a halt for a full 16 days in October, leaving the country struggling to function without all but the most vital federal services. [429] Even the Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer, a conservative, called the renegades “the Suicide Caucus”. [429] \n\n### Political extremists now had no incentive to compromise, even with their own party’s leadership. [429] Instead, the threats faced by Republican members from the new ultraconservative districts were primary challenges from even more conservative candidates. [429] Statistics showed that the 80 members of the Suicide Caucus represented only 18% of the country’s population and 1/3 of the Republican caucus in the House. [429]\n\n### After failure from the Koch’s troubled data collection effort, Themis, in 2012, the Koch donors invested millions of dollars into i360, a state-of-the-art political data company and merged the two. [452] The operation hired 100 staffers and assembled detailed portraits of 250 million U.S. consumers and over 190 million active voters. [452-453] Field workers of the Koch’s many advocacy groups constantly updated the data to determine which voters were “persuadable” and bombard them with personalized communications aimed at motivating them to vote or stay home. [453] \n\n### Before, the Republican National Committee handled voter files. [453] But the Kochs now had their own data bank, which many found easier to use and more sophisticated than the RNC’s. [453] Several top Republican candidates started to purchase i360’s data, even though they were more expensive, they were better. [453] Ironically, the Republican Party found itself sidelined and imperiled by the rapaciousness of its own biggest donors. [453] \n\n&gt; A source “close to the RNC” told Yahoo, “It’s pretty clear that they don’t want to work with the party but want to supplant it”. [453]\n\nAFP expanded to 550 paid staffers, with as many as 50 in a single pivotal state like Florida. [454] Koch-backed advocacy groups like Generation Opportunity and the LIBRE Initiative planted grassroots organizers wherever there were hotly contested elections. [454] The Koch network added Aegis Strategic to recruit and train candidates to avoid the misfits who plagued Republicans in 2012. [454] On November 4, 2014, Election Day proved a Republican triumph, with the GOP picking up 9 Senate seats, winning control of both congressional chambers. [454]\n\n## By 2015, nonstarters were: addressing global warming, raising taxes or closing special loopholes on the runaway rich, while political movement for funding public services such as infrastructure or expanding the social safety net seemed to have disappeared. [459-460] The Kochs and their ultra-wealthy allies on the right had become arguably the single most effective special-interest group in the country. [461] \n\nArthur Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), said conservatives lost the 2012 election because only 1/3 of the public agreed with the statement that Republicans “care about people like you”. [436] Conservatives had an empathy problem. [436] \n\nRichard Fink, Charles Koch’s “grand strategist”, executive VP and board director of both Koch Industries and AFP, threw himself into a comprehensive internal review after the election, which analyzed 20 years of research into political opinions, based on 170,000 surveys from the US and abroad as well as many meetings and focus groups. [439] \n\n&gt; Leaked by Lauren Windsor, a young, little-known blogger who went from libertarianism to crusading against big money in politics, Fink told the donors at Koch’s semiannual June 2014 summit that their challenge was that the country was divided into three distinct parts: 1/3 already in support of Koch’s conservative, libertarian agenda, 1/3 liberals or “collectivists” who were beyond the Koch’s reach and 1/3 were the “middle 1/3” who “will determine the direction of the country” - **“the battle for the future of the country is who can win the hearts and minds of the middle third”** [439-440]\n\n&gt; He explained that the government-slashing agenda of the Koch network was a problem for the middle third. [440] “We want to decrease regulations. Why? It’s because we can make more profit, okay? Yeah, and cut government spending so we don’t have to pay so much in taxes. There’s truth in that”. [440] But the middle third of American voters were uncomfortable with positions that seemed motivated by greed. [440]\nInstead, **they wanted a clean environment and health and high standards of living, as well as political and religious freedom and peace and security**. [441]\n\nThe improved pitch was to “launch a movement for well-being” - to preach that free markets were the way to happiness, while big government led to tyranny and fascism, because they caused dependency, which then caused psychological depression and then totalitarianism. [442] Interestingly enough, Koch was not worried that recently promoting his son, Chase, to the presidency of Koch Fertilizer would “cause dependency”, depression and totalitarianism, saying how his son had at “every step, he’s done it on his own”. [443] \n\nTo this end, Fink explained that the Kochs would form and publicize partnerships with unlikely allies to “earn the respect and good feeling” of the middle third. [443] For example, Mark Holden, general counsel of Koch Industries, confirmed in an interview that the Kochs became active in criminal justice reform after the Clinton Justice Department charged Koch Industries in 2000 with environmental crimes regarding benzene, for which it paid a $20 million fine to avoid jail time for its employees. [443] So while supporting the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, the Kochs added a partnership with the United Negro College Fund. [443-445]\n\nThe Kochs also focused on education as a delivery system for the donors’ conservative ideology and as a long-range strategy to change the country’s political makeup. [447] A 2015 report by an Art Pope-connected nonprofit said, “Money talks loudly on college campuses”. [447-448] For example, former Cato Institute chairman, John Allison, oversaw grants to 63 colleges that all required the programs to teach his favorite philosopher, the celebrator of self-interest Ayn Rand. [448] At Florida State University, where a Koch foundation grant in 2008 gave the foundation a say in faculty hires, one undergraduate complained that his introductory economics class had a textbook cowritten by a former recipient of Koch funds, Russell Sobel, that argued that “climate change wasn’t caused by humans and isn’t a big issue”. [448]\n\nCharles also devised a nonprofit called the Young Entrepreneurs Academy which formed an agreement with the financially pressed Topeka school system to teach that Franklin Roosevelt didn’t alleviate the Depression, minimum wage laws and public assistance hurt the poor, lower pay for women was not discriminatory and that the government, rather than business, caused the 2008 recession. [448-449] The program was aimed at low-income areas and paid students to take additional courses online. [449]\n## They didn’t want to merely win elections; they wanted to change how Americans thought [461] - which was to agree with Charles Koch when he said, in response to splitting a treat with others as a child, “I just want my fair share - which is all of it” [465]\n",

Stick to 5-6 strong bullets that accurately summarize your responsibilities and quantifiable impacts\n\n* Systems Engineer's bullets aren't aligned with the rest\n\n* Include months in your date ranges. Change Current to Present\n\n* Do you really have certificates in everything you listed?

I currently use version 5.7.1 and it works most of the time without issues. but I also had some struggles in the past with some older controllers. so you could try to run an older version of novalct.\n\nif all these options don't work you might try a factory reset of your vx400",

        "selftext": "Yesterday, Trump pardoned the [founder of Silk Road](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/21/politics/silk-road-ross-ulbricht-pardon-trump/index.html) \\- a criminal website designed to anonymously trade illicit drugs, weapons and services.\n\nThe individual had been jailed for life in 2015 after an FBI sting.\n\nBut **libertarian** interest groups had lobbied Donald Trump, saying it was *“government overreach”* to imprison the man, and so, as one of his first acts as second term President, Trump pardoned the individual unconditionally.\n\nLibertarianism is of course the ideology that ACT touts - as does Stuff columnist Damien Grant, and the entire Atlas Network. \n\nPeter Thiel too - whose plans to build an 1800 sqm luxury lodge overlooking Wanaka Lakes, was rejected by NZ’s [Environment Court.](https://lwb.co.nz/content/qldc-and-thiel-ordered-to-pay-costs-after-failed-lodge-proposal/) Queenstown District Local Council [was also slammed](https://crux.org.nz/crux-news/judge-slams-councils-role-as-luxury-wanaka-lodge-rejected-again/) in the process.\n\nI’m going to guess that Thiel is probably not used to hearing *“no”* in these matters.\n\nBut New Zealand’s Environment Court and other parts of the NZ judiciary, including the[ now de-toothed Waitangi Tribunal](https://mountaintui.substack.com/p/clearing-the-decks-government-replaces), have a proud history of strength, and the protection of NZ’s once core interests - our environment, our communities, our people, our lands, and commitments.\n\nBut libertarianism rejects that role.\n\nAfter all, it’s essentially a group that claims government and the ‘state’ shouldn’t intervene in *“personal liberty”, “property rights*”, “*prosperity*” and *“freedom”.*[*1*](https://mountaintui.substack.com/p/new-zealand-first-no-more#footnote-1-155426960)\n\nThese stated ideals provide an excuse for them to lobby governments to loosen or change laws that don’t serve libertarianism e.g by weakening environmental or worker protections by calling them [“red and green tape”](https://www.1news.co.nz/2024/03/07/one-stop-shop-fast-track-consenting-process-established/).\n\nBut policy ideas premised on e.g. cutting red tape have also led to disasters like UK’s [Greenfell Towers](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-61027161) incident.\n\nIronically, these same libertarians will commonly implement and enforce laws that benefit their donors/backers e.g push to [lower or eliminate taxes](https://www.thestarpress.com/story/opinion/columnists/2024/02/04/libertarians-might-not-be-keen-on-consequences-of-eliminating-taxes/72456163007/) for the wealthy and corporate class, or implement policies to favour certain industries and groups\n\nExample - in New Zealand, we’ve seen some of them push hard to benefit [landlords](https://taranaki.nzpif.dev.nzpif.org.nz/news/view/62211) and the [ECE sector businesses](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/536982/early-childhood-education-regulations-excessive-and-confusing-ministry) despite the latter policies putting children at “risk” (1News’s December 2024 article on that topic [appears to have been wiped](https://www.1news.co.nz/2024/12/18/ece-regulations-excessive-and-confusing-ministry/) from its website)\n\n**We can summarise it this way** \\- it’s uber wealthy people running their demands, and in New Zealand, we have the same type of ‘loyal workers’ in government as the US, who are willing to help these uber wealthy - in my personal opinion.\n\nThe fact that libertarians were able to get Trump to release their model criminal so early on speaks to their immense power and reach - because of course - it’s a big-money system, isn’t it?\n\n**Some people on the left** begrudge and attack capitalism, but parts such as healthy and free competition, innovation, risks and rewards, and the like, are not negative aspects in and of themselves.\n\nIt’s when the system becomes convoluted, our society’s **values** and ways of being one-eyed, and resources overweighted towards the few who would game it for their own means - and effectively have infinite resources to do so - that we have the issues we are now seeing.\n\n*Of note, the issues were always there - we were all told of them before. But it somehow takes the farcical nature of current politics for many of us to finally take note. That in and of itself, is not a bad thing.*\n\nThese wealthiest game the system through techniques such: as creating large numbers of special purpose organisations to push political purposes - these include [junk tanks](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/29/rightwing-thinktank-conservative-boris-johnson-brexit-atlas-network), lobbyists, [corrupt researchers](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/mar/02/fossil-fuel-industry-caught-taking-a-page-out-of-the-tobacco-playbook), they fund [disinformation](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/mar/02/fossil-fuel-industry-caught-taking-a-page-out-of-the-tobacco-playbook) campaigns e.g. on climate denial, run and manipulate media, channel large sums of money through dark money webs, and subsequently, even buy entire government politicians to do their will.\n\nDr Neal Curtis, who wrote: [“The corporate class takes over America”](https://newsroom.co.nz/2025/01/22/the-corporate-class-takes-over-america/) for Newsroom yesterday had this in an unedited piece ([ can be found on my Substack](https://mountaintui.substack.com/p/new-zealand-first-no-more))\n\nLibertarianism wouldn’t be a huge problem if it was consistent to its stated aims, but in my opinion, it is a danger because it’s used as pretext by some of the wealthiest to do what they will.\n\nAs Curtis notes, Peter Thiel, the libertarian, once said [freedom and democracy are not compatible.](https://web.archive.org/web/20130429131334/http://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/04/13/peter-thiel/the-education-of-a-libertarian/)\n\nAnd if libertarians like David Seymour are all about freedom — well, **you do the translation.**\n\nThis government has 23 more months, give or take, of direct control - and judging by the speed and way it’s done things, it will get it done. \n\nIf it’s successful to its aims, by the time it’s finished, no government “red tape” or Māori Treaty, or pesky judiciary, should hold folks such as Peter Thiel back.\n\nThat’s the idea and culmination of multiple legislative changes, including the [Regulatory Standards Bill](https://e-tangata.co.nz/comment-and-analysis/the-dangerous-bill-flying-under-the-radar/), [Treaty Principles Bill](https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/sc/make-a-submission/document/54SCJUST_SCF_227E6D0B-E632-42EB-CFFE-08DCFEB826C6/principles-of-the-treaty-of-waitangi-bill/), Overseas Investment Amendment Bill *(see below)*, [Crime (Countering Foreign Interference) Amendment Bill](https://norightturn.blogspot.com/2024/11/nationals-tyrannical-foreign.html) etc.\n\nThe changes they are making are intentional, and will be effective for libertarianism.\n\n# Mountain Tui is a reader-supported publication.

The big money is here. \n\nSource: [Mountain Tui Substack Article - NZ First - No More](https://mountaintui.substack.com/p/new-zealand-first-no-more) (Jan 2025)",

The first reference is to the Greek god of Chaos, Eris, about whom Homer wrote in Book Four of the Iliad: “[Eris] whose wrath is relentless … is the sister and companion of murderous Ares, she who is only a little thing at the first, but thereafter grows until she strides on the earth with her head striking heaven. She then hurled down bitterness equally between both sides as she walked through the onslaught making men’s pain heavier.”\n\nThe passive phrasing of the Latin also echoes the words of the second-century BCE Roman senator Cato the Elder, who roamed the Senate repeating the words Carthago delenda est—”Carthage must be destroyed.” In 149 BCE, Cato got his way and Rome attacked the North African city, located near present-day Tunis. Three years after beginning their assault, the Roman army overran Carthage, tore down its walls, and sold its inhabitants into slavery. After the Roman Senate declared that no one would ever again live where the city had stood, legend holds that Rome salted the earth around the city in order to ensure that Carthage would remain a wasteland.”\nSource: https://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/24/paglen.php\n\n#2 Get Your Kicks on 66\nSymbolism of Diety Moloch \n\nThe famous old American highway “Route 66” was laid out by Freemasons with the apparent intention of sending masses of automobile riders into a self-processing occult “trip.”\n\nRoute 66 began at the Buckingham Fountain in Chicago, near the site of the University of Chicago’s collection of Aztec ritual incunabula. It ended in Barstow, California in the Mohave desert, which is for the Freemasons, the cosmic graveyard of the West, the final destiny of Anubis, the celestial jackal, otherwise known as Sirius (see Giorgio de Santillana andHertha Von Dechend, Hamlet’s Mill: An Essay on Myth and th Frame of Time, p. 358).\n\nIf this version of Route 66 smacks of some medieval pilgrimage made more appropriately on a camel than by car, it is for good reason. Most of Route 66 was based on a road forged in 1857 by Lt. Edward Beale and his caravan of the U.S. Camel Corps.”\n– Michael A. Hoffman II, Secret Societies and Psychological Warfare\n\n#1 The Devil You Know\nThis patch for NROL-49  depicts a phoenix rising from the flames with the flag of the United States in the background. The Latin words “Melior Diabolus Quem Scies” roughly translates to mean “The Devil You Know,” as in the phrase “Better the devil you know than the devil you don’t know”. Cryptic. According to NASA, this saying refers to the return of the use of an old system after attempting to use a new one, which had resulted in failure.\n\n“The mission patch for NRO L-49 shows a phoenix rising out of a fire, with the words “melior diabolus quem scies”, which translate into English as “better the devil you know”, indicating the return to the older system following the failure of the attempt to replace it.”\nSource:  https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2011/01/live-delta-iv-heavy-launch-nro-l-49/\n\nhttps://vigilantcitizen.com/vigilantreport/top-10-most-sinister-psyops-mission-patches/\n\n***\n\nUS Psyops \n\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa_BKX1Xxi3flcqyvh-RlNyaaqNPiWDa3&amp;si=xBccFZnK5RXj3fBl\n\n***\n\nPentagon PSYOP Scandal Demands an Urgent Debate on Propaganda Ethics\n\nIt’s time for a public debate about clandestine PSYOPs, argues Dr. Emma L.

You will focus on emerging threats and evolving operational environments.\n\nResponsibilities:\n\nAs a Special Operations Planner, you will be embedded with SOF efforts to provide overwatch of operations and to ensure the development of proper mitigation strategies as required. \n\nYour in-depth knowledge of Irregular Warfare, Unrestricted Warfare, and Hybrid Warfare as it applies to each unique operational event or tasking will allow you to seek out, identify, plan for, propose, integrate, and evaluate exquisite capabilities in support of Special Operations. \n\nYour efforts also include, developing and maintaining comprehensive operational plans that align with USSOCOM's strategic objectives, collaborating with inter-agency partners and multinational forces to ensure cohesive planning efforts, and utilizing advanced analytics and emerging technologies to enhance planning capabilities.\n\nhttps://careers.caci.com/global/en/job/313651/Special-Operations-Planner\n\n***\n\nU.S. military has renamed Psychological Operations (PSYOP) to Military Information Support Operations (MISO). \nThis change was directed by the Department of Defense in 2010. The term PSYOP was deemed to have negative connotations, implying manipulation and deceit, while MISO was intended to be a more accurate and less offensive term. \nHowever, the name change has not been consistently applied, and the term PSYOP is still used in some contexts, particularly within the Army. \n\nInitial Change:\nIn 2010, a Department of Defense memorandum officially changed the name from PSYOP to MISO. \n\nReason for Change:\nThe term PSYOP was perceived as having negative connotations, such as propaganda and manipulation, which did not accurately reflect the nature of the activities, which rely on truthful information 🤔\n\nInconsistent Application:\nWhile the Department of Defense adopted MISO, the Army continued to use PSYOP in some contexts, including unit names and within the career field. \n\nReturn to PSYOP:\nIn 2017, the U.S. Army Special Operations Command (USASOC) reverted the name back to PSYOP, stating that PSYOP refers to the unit name while MISO refers to the function performed by soldiers in those units. \n\nOngoing Debate:\nThe renaming issue remains a topic of discussion and debate, with some arguing that MISO is a more appropriate term for the function, while others prefer the traditional PSYOP. \n\nhttps://sof.news/io/miso-name-change/\n\n***\n\nWhat’s in a Name?\n\nPsychological Operations versus Military Information Support Operations and an Analysis of Organizational Change\nMaj.

THAT INCLUDES THE US!\n\nThe project has been likened by web experts to China's attempts to control and restrict free speech on the internet.

The worst part about manipulated information is that it is regularly conducted by countries to create and spread propaganda—potentially leading to social divides both foreign and domestically.\n\nSocial media is the battleground of information, where news about any domestic or global event can be distorted, distracted, dismissed, denied, or dismayed.  Validating information displayed can be complicated to verify and accurately interpret, because the flow of information displayed through online discourse or “news coverage,” can appear as normal information from legitimate and credible sources. \n\nhttps://sites.suffolk.edu/jhtl/2022/04/04/psych-ops-21st-century-warfare-through-the-use-of-misinformation-and-disinformation-on-social-media/\n\n***\n\nHere's How the U.S. Military Hacks People's Brains: Darknet Diaries \n\nhttps://youtu.be/zLWuuV0lBhU?si=zSqo6eDwZTJYenG8\n➕\nhttps://darknetdiaries.com/episode/65/\n\n***\n\nAssociation of the United States Army\nhttps://www.ausa.org\nPDF\nImproving Tactical PSYOP Video Dissemination in Media-Austere ...\n\nhttps://www.ausa.org/sites/default/files/LWP-50-Improving-Tactical-PSYOP-Video-Dissemination-in-Media-Austere-Operating-Environments.pdf\n\n***\n\nUS Government Corruption \n\nThe US Government declared they had a right to attack US Citizens on American Soil, therefore Psyops has been fully engaged on the entire US Population in addition to other means the Government declares it has an (Immoral Unethical &amp; Constitutionally \"Illegal\") \"Right\" to do.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/u/JulieG350Jgs/s/hPimxbkZ1y\n➕\nhttps://www.reddit.com/u/JulieG350Jgs/s/mAwTiP1ANH\n\n***\n\nDistinguishing between what is \"Real\" from what's been \"Staged\"..........\n\nPsychological Warfare=Battle for Control over the Minds and Souls of Humanity.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/b3AN2wY4qAM?si=dYE61notLF2YJolr\n\n*\n\nThis needs to be revisited because apparently people are still deaf dumb blind and willfully ignorant by continuing to allow themselves to be manipulated by the Psyops Programs.\n\nHow the US Government \"Legalized\" the use of Military Police State Operations and Psyops Programs upon their own Citizens.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/u/JulieG350Jgs/s/p4Emcblnnp\n\n***",

PERHAPS A RETURN TO ROYAL TREATMENT WILL DO HER GOOD!\"\n\nAs Leia fetches another gorg, Jabba looks between the wanted images of the twi'lek &amp; mandalorian, \n\"SUCH BEAUTY WOULD BE WASTED ROTTING AWAY IN IMPERIAL PRISONS- THEY WOULD FAIR BETTER WITH ME, DON'T YOU AGREE?\"\n\nLeia slowly nods before she feeds her master another amphibian,\n\"Master, the Empire wouldn't let you keep such wanted prisoners-argh!\"\n\n\"DO NOT SPEAK OF MATTERS YOU KNOW NOT.\" Jabba snorts tugging her chain,\n\"THE NEW EMPEROR ONLY CARES ABOUT WHAT INFORMATION YOUR WANTED FRIENDS HAVE- THEIR FATES ARE LEFT TO ME!\"\n\nJabba then wraps his arm around Leia's waist and keeps her focused on the wanted holoposters,\n\"SO MANY TO CHOOSE FROM- BUT WHICH ONES HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON WITH YOU, KHANKEE?\"\n\nLeia thinks for a moment before licking her slimy lips, \"Winter...Evaan...Jan Ors...Cara Dune...they're all Alderaanians, like me.\"\n\nJabba squeezes Leia's stomach, \"HOW DELIGHTFULLY DELICIOUS IT WOULD BE TO HAVE SOME OF THE LAST WOMEN OF ALDERAAN IN MY NEW HAREM!\"\n\nLeia then gasps as Jabba turns her around to face him with her chain held taunt,\n\"ALL I NEED TO DO IS FIND THEM BEFORE THE EMPIRE DOES...TELL ME WHERE THEY ARE!\"\n\n\"I don't know-!\" Leia chokes out as Jabba's tail begins to squeeze her legs,\n\"I thought they all died over Endor! I have no idea where any new or secret bases are!\"\n\nJabba rips Leia's bra off and begins to pinch her nipples, making her stifle mewls before he stops,\n\"I ONCE HEARD RUMORS OF A GREAT MIGRATION OF SURVIVING ALDERAANIANS TO FIND A NEW HOMEWORLD- LED BY YOU.\"\n\nLeia bites her lip and turns her head away,\n\"We never found a new world- and- even if we did- I-I would never tell you- master.\"\n\nJabba burps some leftover gorg juices all over Leia's face and breasts before he pushes her down before him,\n\"TURN AROUND AND GET ON YOUT HANDS AND KNEES- YOUR DEFIANCE IS SWEET, BUT NOT UNBREAKABLE.\"\n\nLeia closes her eyes and moves skirts aside and gets on her hands and knees, allowing Jabba to grab her ass before his tail wraps around her waist before plunging into her tight anus-\n\nThe sudden penetration causes Leia to open her eyes and moan, and she grasps at the pillows and carpets below as Jabba thrusts his tail deeper-\n\nThis goes on for a while until as Jabba gets close to his climax, he spanks Leia and grunts,\n\"YOUR REBELLION IS FINISHED- THE EMPIRE WILL FIND AND DESTROY YOUR PEOPLE- UNLESS I FIND IT FIRST, HO-HO-HO!\"\n\nAs Leia feels herself gush with how much slimy cum Jabba fills her rear, she can't help but think about how her remaining people are without the rebellion, and if revealing the location to Jabba would be better off than extinction from the Empire...\n...\n\n\"You've all been deliberating to yourselves for far too long- give me your response.\" Winter Retrac asks in a commanding, yet delicate tone to the ruling alderaanian council within their capital building within the city of New Aldera, on New Alderaan.\n\nThrekin Horm, president of the council then grumbles, \"Your request to launch a rescue mission for the confirmed deceased Leia Organa is denied, Miss Retrac.\"\n\n\"There is no visible proof she was killed on her covert mission to Tatooine!\" Winter retorts sharply, \"In all likelihood, she's still a captive of Jabba the Hutt!\"\n\nHalla Ettyk, the justice member of the council sighs, \"Winter, the footage showing Organa as a slave girl to that Hutt is clearly fabricated- propaganda to humiliate the Rebellion- and us!\"\n\nWinter shakes her head, \"I've studied advanced fake holograms, and known Leia since childhood- it's her! Do you want to leave our last princess in the hands of the Hutts?\"\n\nlast surviving member of the council of elders Orinn Tathis stands up, \"Then you want us, all of us to know that our last symbol of hope has been reduced to a mere enslaved concubine-? I think we can all agree she is better off dead, in the eyes of our people-\"\n\n\"How dare you say that- after everything she did!\" Winter says fiercely, with some tears in her eyes-\n\n\"Enough!\" Rickert Beagle suddenly speaks, \"New Alderaan has greater concerns Retrac- such as our secrecy and temporary self-sustainability, after the Rebel Alliance was destroyed.\"\n\n As Winter turns her back on the council with a deep glare, Egyln Valmor adds, \"If you, or anyone else does leave the system to pursue that fruitless mission, you will find yourself indefinitely confined to Cantham Cellar- no matter how many good deeds you did for the Rebellion.\"\n\n\"So, how'd it go-? Oh.\" Tycho Celchu says slowly as he, Evaan and a dozen pilots and commandos stand up once Winter steps into the large hangar full of cruisers and starfighters.\n\nEvaan Verlaine, one of the lone survivors of Gold Squadron notices Winter's expression, \"They said no? Why?\"\n\n\"They believe it's a lost cause...\" Winter says in a small voice, \"They'd rather let everyone think she's dead.\"\n\n\"That's a load of Nerf fodder!\" Cara Dune, a seasoned drop trooper retorts, stepping out of the crowds of soldiers, \"Princess Leia's the reason I'm here, and probably most of us! If we ever have a shot at taking down the Empire, she's the beacon of hope we need right now!\"\n\nFormer Rebel officer Kira Lar shakes her head, \"Even if we disobey the council, where do we go? Tatooine? We don't even know where Leia is, or even if she is still alive!\"\n\nBefore anyone can reply, a hangar side door opens, and the highest-ranking Rebel leader on New Alderaan, General Rieekan steps out, \"This wouldn't be a conspiracy to free the princess, is it? The council were explicit on their answer.\"\n\nWinter steps over close to Rieekan, \"And what of it? Are you going to report this?\"\n\nRieekan offers a weary smile, \"There's another reason the council doesn't want you to cross with the Hutts- they're planning on reaching out to them- for support.\"\n\n\"You can't be serious- sir.\" Tycho says aghast, with Cara, Evaan and many others shake their heads.\n\n\"They're not happy about it either- but without the Rebellion, New Alderaan can't survive without trade long term- councilwoman Janis Pol is preparing to make a treaty deal as we speak.\" Rieekan says in a tired voice-\n\n\"I understand trading with merchants, smugglers and even pirates- but the Hutt Cartel-?!\" pilot Kasan Moor cries out amidst the uproar, \"They'll backstab us, enslave us, then sell us out to the Empire anyway!\"\n\n\"The council has anticipated that- it's why Ettyk sent undercover agents to scope out Hutt Space- at the moment, the Empire is going after every criminal syndicate besides the Hutts- it's our only shot.\" Rieekan says before he lowers his voice, \"But that's not all they've discovered.\"\n\nRieekan takes out a hologram, showing a half-dozen slave girls dancing erotically, and among them a familiar face-\n\n\"Leia!\" Evaan says almost in a shout, \"I can't believe she's alive...like this...\"\n\n\"This was recorded just days ago- on Nal Hutta.\" Rieekan says grimly, \"Jabba the Hutt's become the head of the Hutt Clans, and he still holds Organa has his prisoner- I'm sorry.\"\n\nCara suddenly gives Rieekan a back crushing hug, \"Sorry? This is wonderful! If she's on Nal Hutta, we need to bust her free- now!\"\n\nSelnia Trigg steps up, \"But we can't take on the Hutt blockade, even with all the attack cruisers in the Survivor's fleet!\"\n\nA few other murmurs of agreement go around before Winter speaks, \"We don't need a battle fleet to free Leia- we just need a plan, and I have one! Anyone who wants to get our princess back, come with me!\"\n\nHalf the group cheers in agreement, while the other half offer reluctant looks, with Rieekan stepping over to Winter, \"I won't be joining you- but if you come back with Leia- I think the council will understand.\"\n\nWinter offers him a hopeful smile before Rieekan and half of the force begins to leave the hanger, then she walks over to Tycho who bears a grim expression, \"You don't have to come with me...this is personal...\"\n\nTycho takes Winter's hands, \"Its personal to all of us. And... after I abandoned my teammates on Endor, I need this- I need to do something good.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you're with me Tycho.\" Winter squeezes Tycho's hand, \"We shall rescue Leia together- my beloved.\"\n\n\"Then- you accept my proposal?\" Tycho says noticing a ring on Winter's hand, \"I thought you said it was too soon-\"\n\nWinter gives Tycho a kiss before she walks away with a smile, \"That's because we might all die on this mission- now go prepare all the cruisers and ships we can spare, captain.\"\n\nAs Tycho prepare the larger Alderaanian ships, Winter moves to Evaan, \"I can only tell my full plan to a trusted few- you and Tycho are the only ones I-\" \n\n\"Actually...I'm going to sit this one out.\" Evaan says in a small voice, and seeing Winter's shocked expression she adds, \"Not because I'm scared- I am, but someone needs to be in charge of the defense fighters here.\"\n\nCara Dune suddenly steps over Evaan, \"Didn't you once tell me you pledged your life to Leia? Have a change of heart?\"\n\nEvaan raises her hands, \"I did- but I also made an oath- to protect our new home. If you fail, or heck, even if you succeed, there will be chaos to pay- I need to be here, prepared for anything.\"\n\nWinter steps between Cara and Evaan, \"We've all been through a lot these past months...losing the rebellion...and many friends...so I understand if some aren't ready to risk it all again.\"\n\nEvaan steps back and shrugs in her yellow jacket, \"Hey, I'm not against getting into battle, I'm still digesting the fact that the Emperor's dead, Vader replaced him, and the hot Jedi I slept with betrayed us to be his sidekick!- Oh, and if you get the chance, blow up Nal Hutta on your way out- good luck!\"\n\nAs Evaan walks away, Cara turns to Winter, \"If you want this plan of yours to go smoothly, it'd be best if both the flight and ground force leaders got an idea what we're doing- that includes me.\"\n\nWinter nods before she takes out a small white box, \"This operation requires...negotiation.\"\n\n...\n\n\"I AM MOST PLEASED YOU AGREED TO MY OFFER, SYKES.\" Jabba chuckles to the hologram of the nabooian crime leader of the Zann Consortium within his personal audience chamber, \"I'M SURE MY FORMER CONCUBINE IS PROVIDING MORE THAN TRADE DEALS, HO-HO-HO!\"\n\nSykes looks away anxiously, \"I don't know how Kateel lost her memory, but her time as 'Neelah' has certainly altered her behavior...besides that, our alliance is in motion- the Consortium's fleet is at your disposal, Lord Jabba.\"\n\n\"GOOD, GOOD!\" Jabba gurgles as he shuts the hologram off and turns to Bib Fortuna at his side, \"FETCH MY DANCERS! A CELEBRATION FOR OUR FIRST PACT SHALL COMMENCE!\"\n\nLying against Jabba's belly, Leia quietly groans, knowing she would soon be required to dance for her depraved master, and relieve the lust she brought him-\n\nBefore Bib can even leave the chamber, Jabba's hologram suddenly flickers, and a figure appears, once which catches the attention of both the Hutt and Leia- Winter Celchu.\n\nLeia sits up in fear of her childhood best friend seeing her in such a demeaning way, only to notice the hologram to be a prerecorded message, which speaks confidently, \"Jabba Desilijic Tiure, you are currently in possession of someone of great importance to us- Leia Organa.\"\n\nJabba's eyes narrow with interest and suspicion as he holds Leia's chain tight as Winter continues, \"I do not wish this to end in bloodshed, which is why I am offering you this deal: in exchange for our princess, you will receive something even more priceless: the last crown jewels of Alderaan.\"\n\nJabba, along with Bib and the rest of his current court stare at the open box of glimmering gems greedily before Winter shuts it, \"If you agree to our terms, meet us personally with the princess at the southern ridge region of Stalimur. If you turn against this deal in any way, you will pay most dearly. Be here before the start of the next solar rotation- good day.\"\n\nWinter's message ends, leaving the Nal Hutta court in silence. Leia's mind races, first with wonder, then hope- but it vanishes as she feels Jabba's belly rumble, reminding her of her place- and she already knew what her master's decision would be.\n\nWhispers fill the court before Bib leans down and murmurs to Jabba's side, \"Are you considering this proposition, my lord?\"\n\n\"OF COURSE NOT!\" Jabba snorts out, smacking Fortuna back, \"I WILL NOT GIVE UP MY FAVORITE DECORATION- AND YOU KNOW HOW I LIKE TO BARGAIN, RIGHT MY SWEET SCHUTTA?\"\n\nLeia lowers her head and nods, making the court fill with laughter as Jabba booms, \"THIS WINTER WOMAN WILL SOON LEARN HER PLACE SOON, HO-HO-HO!\"\n\nBib gets back on the dais and rubs his lekku, \"Master, are you not concerned on how this wanted fugitive managed to bypass our secure hologram network? Or what allies or weapons they might possess?\"\n\n\"ALL WILL BE DISCOVERED EVENTUALLY.\" Jabba rumbles confidently as he reaches for a paddy frog, \"AS FOR PRESSING MATTERS, FIRST, WHERE IS OUR ESTEEMED IMPERIAL LIAISON?\"\n\n\"Jixton is currently being entertained by our Harem Mistress in the outer lounge room.\" Bib hisses enviously, \"Shall I retrieve him? And assemble an elite guard, and our new fleet?\"\n\n\"LET'S KEEP JIX OUT OF THE LOOP- FOR NOW.\" Jabba chuckles deviously, \"AND BEGIN PREPARATIONS FOR OUR DEPATURE AT ONCE!\"\n\nAs the court's guards and thugs scramble to move, Jabba clutches Leia's chain as he turns his gaze to the bounty hunter booths section of his audience chamber, where his current favorite bounty hunter, Dengar, lays with Manaroo, while Bossk gropes Nima'Tar &amp; Beedo openly fucks Greeata.\n\n\"DENGAR!\" Jabba bellows, making Leia sit up against his slimy gut as the bandaged bounty hunter gets up and rushes before the Hutt, \"I'm ready for anything, boss.\"\n\n\"DID YOU FIND THE BOUNTY HUNTER I REQUESTED THE SERVICES OF?\" Jabba asks sharply, keeping his hand over the trapdoor button which Dengar stands on.\n\n\"I did, she's already here!\" Dengar gulps, \"She's around here somewhere- she's that good, right?\"\n\nJabba snorts loudly, \"SHE HAD BETTER BE, OR YOU BOTH WILL SUFFER A WORSE FATE THAN THE SARLACC PIT- NOW GO!\"\n\nAs Jabba's minions prepare to lift to Hutt out of the audience chamber, Jabba leans down and strokes Leia's shoulders, before tugging at her bra strap, \"LET'S ENJOY SOME FRESH ALONE TIME, SHALL WE?\"\n\n...\n\nJabba's personal space yacht, the Star Jewel arrives out of hyperspace outside the Tion Hegemony Outer Rim world of Stalimur, followed by a cluster of Kossak-class frigates, a couple Krayt gunships and a dozen kimogila heavy starfighters, which all descended down to the planet below.\n\nWithin the Star Jewel's private chambers, Leia stares out the wide side window at the world getting closer, for the first time in months, without her collar around her neck.\n\nLeia's entire slave outfit is gone, from arm bands to headpieces, leaving Organa truly naked- but she still wore what Jabba gives her- this time only in the form of slimy drool and semen, which coats her breasts, neck, face, stomach, backside and drips out of her womanhood as her master pulls his tail out.\n\nAs Jabba smokes from his hookah after ravishing his completely bare slave, Leia looks down at the night filled sky of Stalimur, where she finds herself drawn to small native settlements down below, especially the curious sight of dozens of candles being lit all over-\n\nJabba slimes over to his slave's side and notices her gaze, \"A CURIOUS SIGHT, IS IT NOT? DO YOU KNOW WHY THIS WORLD AND MANY IN THE TION HEGEMONY SECTOR DO THIS?\"\n\nLeia continues to stare silently as Jabba wraps his arm around her waist, \"ITS A HOLIDAY THE HUTTS KNOW VERY WELL. THE DEVOURING. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?\"\n\nJabba squeezes her waist, and Leia slowly shakes her head, making Jabba chuckle, \"I THOUGHT NOT. A CORE WORLD PRINCESS LIKE YOU KNOWS NOTHING THIS FAR OUT. ITS AN ANCIENT HOLIDAY DEDICATED TO THE LOST TIONESE COLONIES IN THE KIIRIUM REACHES- DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM?\"\n\n\"No master.\" Leia says in an empty monotone voice as she stares out, and Jabba snorts, \"HUMANS HAVE COLONIZED THE TION CLUSTER SINCE EVEN BEFORE MY KIND ROSE TO PROMINENCE- BUT THEY ONLY EXPANDED TO THE REACHES ONCE XIM THE DESPOT CREATED HIS EMPIRE- ANY GUESSES WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?\"\n\nJabba's tail pokes at Leia's slimy buttocks, \"THAT TIONESE HUMAN THOUGHT HIMSELF GREATER THAN HUTTS- SO WHEN KOSSAK THE DEVOURER BEAT HIM IN COMBAT, HIS EMPIRE FELL APART- AND EXPANDED OURS GREATLY!\"\n\nJabba's pleased expression shifts into a rare solemness, \"KOSSAK WAS PRAISED FOR CONQUERING XIM AND HIS EMPIRE- BUT WHEN THE TIONESE COLONIES CLOSE TO HUTT SPACE TRIED TO REACH OUT TO THE EARLY REPUBLIC, HE WAS FEARFUL OF AN ALLIANCE.\"\n\n\"THAT IS WHEN THE DEVOURING BEGAN- HUTT WARSHIPS BOMBARDED THE TIONESE COLONIES TO NOTHING- SPARING NO MAN, WOMAN OR CHILD- THE CLANS CELEBRATE THIS DAY, WHILE TIONESE WORLDS MOURN WHAT HAS BECOME ASH WORLDS.\" Jabba sighs.\n\nLeia's eyes momentarily flash with fearful awareness as Jabba rumbles, \"I ONLY SEE IT AS A WASTE OF VALUABLE RESOURCES- LET US HOPE YOUR FRIENDS DO NOT FORCE ME TO REPEAT IT.\"\n\nJabba's tail slips back into Leia's cunt as he chortles, \"I WILL MAKE SURE YOU GET A GOOD VIEW OF THE OUTCOME EITHER WAY, KHANKEE~\"\n\n...\n\nWinter watches as the Star Jewel lands, standing in the humid yet slightly snowy hilly ridge along with a handful of alderaanian guards, with the Corvette runner ship, The Sundered Heart landed behind them, while a thranta war cruiser, the Courage hovers overhead.\n\nAs the Star Jewel's ramp lowers, the kossak frigates hover overhead, along with the kilogila fighters and krayt gunships.\n\nJabba slimes down and heads over to Winter's company, with Leia fully dressed in her slave attire and chained at his side, while also joined by C-3PO, Dengar, Beedo, his gamorrean executioner Lomrokk and a dozen nikto and klatoonian guards.\n\nUpon getting close to Winter, Jabba licks his lips looking at her cleavage window, making his tail throb as his mind raced about seeing the rest of the intelligence agent without her white outfit-\n\nWinter meanwhile grits her teeth at the sight of Jabba holding Leia and even her former translator droid in such a barbaric way-  \n\nJabba glances over at the white sun setting in the distance, \"JUST IN TIME- DID YOU BRING THE JEWELS?\"\n\nWinter glares at Jabba before nodding and taking out the white box, and opens it up to showing the glowing gems, \"Unchain Leia and we will do a simultaneous exchange.\"\n\n\"I THINK...NOT.\" Jabba laughs, making several of the alderaanian guards raise blasters, with the Hutt's thugs doing so in turn, \"WHY SHOULD I GIVE UP MY FAVORITE SLAVE TO THOSE WHO CAN'T WIN AGAINST MY FORCES?\"\n\nWinter takes out her own blaster with one hand and points it at Jabba, \"I warned you Hutt- do the deal, or die.\"\n\nJabba only booms with laughter, holding Leia's chain taunt, \"YOUR THREATS ARE EMPTY GIRL- SURRENDER NOW, AND YOU AND YOUR FORCES WILL BE SPARED- DO YOU ACCEPT MY NEW DEAL?\"\n\nAll eyes turn to Winter, and she gives Leia a stern stare before she takes a step forward and begins to hand the box of gems- until she takes out a smoke grenade and throws it down-\n\nBlasterfire enters the area as the guards' fire at each other- in the confusion, Winter uses specialized goggles to see through the smoke- and she takes aim before firing at Jabba-\n\nBut the moment the blasterfire hits, it gets absorbed into a ray shield that forms around Jabba's form, with the Hutt laughing, \"I SEE MY NEW WRIST ENERGY SHIELD WORKS PERFECTLY- A FINE GIFT FROM MY NEW CONSORTIUM ALLIES!\"\n\nWinter grits her teeth before she notices Leia's chain isn't fully in the shield and fires at it, severing it-\n\nBefore Jabba can react, Winter rushes over and grabs Leia's hand before leading her away through the smoky battle-\n\nAs they stumble out of the smoke and down a hilly slope, Winter leads Leia towards a landspeeder while saying quickly, \"There's a ship not too far from here- you'll be safe-\"\n\nSuddenly Leia kicks Winter in the back of her knees, making her to the ground-\n\nLeia then tries to grab Winter's blaster, making her push her back in surprise, and gasp, \"What are you doing-? Has he brainwashed you-?\"\n\nLeia, with a strange look on her face tries to take Winter's blaster, only managing to knock it out of Celchu's grasp before she tries to strangle the white-haired agent with the severed chain-\n\nWinter, with some hesitation, kicks Leia in the face, making it transform- revealing her to really be shape-shifting clawdite bounty hunter Cato Parasitti, still wearing Leia's slave bikini-\n\nAs Winter continues to wrestle off the reptilian changeling, she activates her commlink and shouts into it, \"It was an imposter! Attack and capture the Hutt!\"\n\nBack at the upper ridge, the smoke clears while the battle continues, with many of the alderaanian guards being shot down by Dengar, Beedo and the cartel thugs, and before Jabba can slime his way back to the Star Jewel, a U-Wing drops down in front of him-\n\nCara Dune steps out with a heavy repeating blaster along with a dozen commandos, and they open fire, hitting a lot of the niktos in the back before the rest of Jabba's ground forces open fire-\n\nUp above, the Huttese war ships begin to open fire on the Courage, and its hangars open up, allowing nearly two dozen A-wings to fly out, led by Tycho Celchu who begins to attack the larger cartel cruisers-\n\nAs the kilogila snubfighters begin to enter dogfighting against the A-wings, the Krayt gunships dive down and blow up the U-Wing and some of the commandos, before landing and deploying the cybernetically enhanced Gank killers which begin to engage the alderaanians in battle-\n\nDespite orders, Cara Dune takes out a rocket launcher and tries to hit Jabba, only for it to bounce off the ray shield and blow up a gang of klatoonians, and Beedo, even C-3PO-\n\nBefore she can try again, the gamorrean Lomrokk slices her rocket launcher with his ax before he tackles her-\n\nWhile the Hutt war ships manage to shoot down the Courage, one of them is suddenly rammed by the hammerhead corvette, the Duchess Senna, which makes two of the warships collide together-\n\nAs the A-wings manage to shoot down many of the snubfighters, they begin to fight off the krayt gunships- before a half dozen aggressor-class destroyers arrive, led by Bossk within his ship, the Hound's Tooth-\n\nThe turbolasers from the Consortium destroyers incinerates many of the A-wings, and one of the bolts hits the end of Kasan Moor's fighter, making her crash into the bridge of the Duchess Senna-\n\nAs the Hammerhead corvette explodes on the ground below, many of the commandos are shot or sliced by the gank killers and Dengar, and Jabba raises his hands victoriously as the krayt gunships bomb the Sundered Heart, while Lomrokk shoves Cara to the ground-\n\nAbove, Tycho Celchu sees his fellow A-wings get shot down, and before he can reach any of the aggressor cruisers, Bossk tails behind him, before opening fire.\n\nWinter manages to watch just as Tycho's A-wing explodes midair before even crashing, making her cry out, \"Tycho!\"\n\nThen a stun blast hits her from behind- and Cato stands over her, holding up the discarded blaster.\n\n...\n\nWhile Jabba is slightly displeased that only a handful of alderaanians are alive to capture, he licks his lips at the lovely sight of Cara Dune and especially Winter, who is dragged back up by Cato, before the white-haired woman is tossed into the hands of a few gamorreans.\n\nCato stands next to Dengar and crosses her arms with her reptilian exposed in a less appealing manner than Leia, \"I have a holographic disguise matrix that can mimic clothes- did you really want me to wear that Huttese slave outfit so badly?\"\n\nJabba laughs as Winter begins to startle awake, \"I ONCE HAD A CLAWDITE FOR A SLAVE GIRL- IT WAS ENTERTAINING FOR A TIME, BUT SHE KEPT TRANSFORMING INTO HER HIDEOUS FORM!\"\n\nCato rolls her eyes as a guard hands her and Dengar their payment, \"Next time you hire me, I want a more dignified role.\"\n\n\"PERHAPS, BUT DON'T FORGET TO RETURN THAT ATTIRE.\" Jabba chuckles before he notices Winter silently weeping with a small amount of anger on her face, \"YOU SHOULD'VE TAKEN MY OFFER.\"\n\nWinter remains silent before Cara, being held by several gamorreans growls, \"Where's Leia-?!\"\n\nJabba grins widely as he turns around to face the Star Jewel, and one of its windows is revealed under some hull, showing the real Leia, naked and held by Bib Fortuna, who grabs at her chest and mouth.\n\nSeeing Winter's shocked reaction makes Jabba gurgle amusingly, \"PERHAPS WE CAN BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS INSIDE, HO-HO-HO!\"\n...\nAfter scavenging through the ruined alderaanian ships, the Hutt's fleet of cruisers departs the surface of Stalimur and jumps to lightspeed as the night falls.\n\nWithin the Star Jewel's main cabin and Jabba's throne room, many gather around to celebrate the Hutt's victory over the alderaanians, with Winter and Cara held in the center to be mocked-\n\nJust as Jabba finishes his lavish feast, Leia enters into the main chamber, fully dressed back into her skimpy outfit with a chain led by Tia &amp; Ghia-\n\nSeeing Leia makes Jabba's tail thump on the dais as he gurgles, \"AH, LEIA~ JOIN US, THE FUN IS ABOUT TO BEGIN!\"\n\nStill being held by gamorreans, Cara and Winter can only watch as Leia hands Jabba her chain before standing at his side, with a defeated look in her eyes, especially upon seeing her childhood friend.\n\nJabba's excitement meanwhile reaches his peak as he nudges Bib, who holds up the white box of gems, \"THESE WILL FIND A NICE PLACE IN MY TROPHY ROOM, BUT AS FOR YOU...\"\n\nCara and Winter look up as Jabba booms, \"I THINK I WILL KEEP OTHER LOVELY RARITIES FROM ALDERAAN AS WELL- BUT NOT IN SUCH DIRTY, BATTLE TORN CLOTHES- STRIP!\"\n\nThe crowds cheer and Winter glares at Jabba with hate with dried tears in her face, while Cara yells, \"I'd rather fuck a bantha you smelly fat scughole!\"\n\nThe courtiers laugh as Jabba waves his hand at both his musicians and his gamorrean guards,\n\"PERHAPS I WILL GIVE YOU THE CHANCE ONE DAY- STRIP THEM-SLOWLY!\"\n\nLeia tries to look down as Winter cries out while Cara shouts, but Jabba grabs her chin to look at the two women, and sticks his thumb in her mouth-\n\nWhile Cara punches two guards away who rip her armor off, Lomrokk begins to tear her front clothes off, making the crowds cheer, and on the other hand, Winter struggles to fight off even one gamorrean-\n\nWinter's now grimy white dress is easily torn to shreds by the gamorrean who grabs at the white-haired woman, tossing the pieces to the crowds-\n\nSoon Winter is left in her white lingerie, which makes Jabba raise his hand to stop, while the other guards hold Cara in place as Lomrokk rips the rest of her clothes off-\n\nJabba murmurs in Leia's ear, \"HOLD YOUR LOVELY FRIEND CLOSE TO ME~\"\n\nJabba then lightly pushes Leia off his dais, and as she walks over and grabs Winter, Cara is stripped completely naked, with her garments throw around-\n\nJabba enjoys a handful of Bo-toads from his snackquarium before he chortles to a naked Cara &amp; a half-naked Winter held before him, \"BEFORE I GET A GOOD TASTE, PERHAPS YOU CAN SHARE YOUR NAMES.\"\n\n\"Winter- Winter Celchu.\" Winter says in a quiet bitter voice as she clutches her ring finger while Leia holds her from behind-\n\nCara notices Jabba's lustful stare at her muscular, voluptuous body and spits at him-\n\nJabba slurps up her saliva before chuckling,\n\"SUCH SWEETNESS~ BRING HER FIRST!\"\n\nCara screams as Lomrokk holds her arms from behind and shoves her against Jabba's belly-\n\nDune's yells are muffled as Jabba shoves his tongue into her mouth, while his slimy hands grab at her large chest, and rounded backside-\n\nCara tries to bite Jabba's tongue, which is too thick, and it clogs down her throat, making the woman choke as he pinches her nipples and rear-\n\nDune desperately tries to kick Jabba's belly to no avail, but then he pulls out of her mouth, making her cough-\n\nSeeing Cara's bouncing breasts making Jabba's tail wiggle as he opens wide before engulfing her bosom into her large slimy maw-\n\nCara grits her teeth as Jabba slobbers and wraps his tongue around her heaving mounds, covering them in saliva as his hands grope her buttocks-\n\nAs Jabba enjoys the taste of the soldier's rack, his tail snakes around her muscular legs, before reaches between her thighs-\n\nCara screams and tries to keep the tail out, but two gamorreans join Lomrokk and hold her legs apart, allowing the Hutt to shove his appendage down her hairy and slightly wet snatch-\n\nWinter can only watch as Jabba's tail shoves deeper into Cara, who tries her best to not moan with her cunt and chest stimulated, but eventually she begins to orgasm, much to the delight of the crowds-\n\nWhile Jabba jams his tail roughly into the tough rebel, Tia &amp; Ghia offer themselves to the rest of the court, and they begin to blow several of them before being ganged up on-\n\nAfter some time, Jabba finishes inside Cara as she gushes for the third time, and the guards let go of the rebel as she collapses against the side of the Hutt's belly, unconscious.\n\nJabba pulls his tail out of Cara's cunt and watches slime cum spill out before he turns to Winter &amp; Leia, \"STRIP HER FOR ME LEIA~\"\n\n\"You shouldn't come.\" Leia murmurs before she slowly pulls Winter's panties off and rips her bra off, before tossing them to the crowds, who use the underwear to masturbate-\n\nJabba's tail rehardens against Cara's abs as he stares at Winter's bare body- which is nearly identical with Leia's, only with slightly larger breasts.\n\nJabba drools at the sight of her shaven womanhood and wonders if it's as tight as Leia's,\n\"BRING HER!\"\n\nAs Leia pulls Winter towards her master, she whispers in her ear, \"Please try to enjoy.\"\n\nWinter stifles a gasp as her chest mashes against Jabba's chins, as his tongue shoots out and slips into her mouth, while his hands grab at her thighs and shapely ass-\n\nSeeing Winter's discomfort, Leia reaches down and begins to finger her oldest friend, making Celchu moan into Jabba's tongue-\n\nJabba continues to slobber all over Winter's face and breasts as Leia fingers the naked woman, until she gasps out and squirts-\n\nAs Winter slumps against Jabba's belly, the Hutt chuckles to Leia, \"REMOVE YOUR SKIRTS~\"\n\nKnowing what he wants, Leia quickly removes skirts and top, before she allows Jabba to pick her up and his tongue dancing with hers before it descends and goes between her chest, then down to her wet womanhood-\n\nAs Jabba holds Leia up and begins to eat her out, his tail squirms over to a still recovering Winter and makes its way between her legs-\n\nWinter screams into Jabba's belly as his tail penetrates her, being bigger than Tycho or any last lovers, and she finds herself stuck as Leia's legs hug her against the Hutt-\n\n\"YES MASTER~!\" Leia cries out as she orgasms to Jabba's tongue, while Winter, in her grief and shock, lays numbly on her front, ignoring the jeers and catcalls as the large tail fucks her cunt and makes her forget the pain-\n\nIt doesn't take long for Winter to squirt again and again for her Hutt enslaver, and after what feels like hours, Jabba finally explodes, filling her womb full of his vile seed-\n\nAs Winter lays motionless and moans, Leia slumps down Jabba's front exhausted, and watches hazily as the Hutt's tail continues pumps into her best friend-\n\nJabba sleepily sighs as he pops his tail out of Winter's snatch and rubs it all over her smooth buttocks, while feeling Leia &amp; Cara's slumbering forms against his hide makes the Hutt soon drift off along his favorite and newly enslaved alderaanians...\n————————————————————————",

            "body": "In my experience every vendor has approached the SASE buzz based on their starting point. I think a lot of people also forget that SASE is also supposed to incorporate SDWAN also. But a lot of people kind of skip this and just go with SSE style.\n\nPalo Alto &amp; Fortinet: NGFW leaders. Basically just converted their strong NGFW product into SASE by offering what is ostensibly FWaaS with some new addons/acquisitions to meet Gartners definition of SASE. However regarding Fortinet its important to note that their SASE solution is very insular and still requires Fortigates to integrate with it, which in my mind is somewhat counterproductive. Palo's solution is still SDWAN agnostic, but of course they are pushing Prisma SDWAN (AKA Cloudgenix) and to a lesser extent PANOS SDWAN.\n\nCisco: A dogs breakfast of acquisitions to meet Gartners definition\n\nNetskope: Started off as a CASB vendor, then moved to incorporate the SWG and Firewall piece later. These guys are coming at it from the opposite end of the SASE spectrum compared to most others.\n\nZScaler: Probably had the strongest start, given they were a cloud SWG from day 1 and already had 3rd party integration with a lot of the SDWAN vendors. Recently have come to market with their own SDWAN to make their solution SASE end to end.\n\nBut to answer your original question. From what I've seen, Prisma Access predominantly has success when Palo is already the incumbent NGFW vendor. Rarely have a seen Palo have success with greenfield SASE/SSE deployments. Netskope and ZScaler tend to have the advantage here.",

        "selftext": "# 🔥 Because He Sees Through It—and That Terrifies Them\n\nBoy King Tut isn’t fooled by this plastic world:\n\n* He sees the loops.\n* He sees the time glitches.\n* He sees how they harvest emotion, confuse identity, and bury divine memory beneath “mental health” labels. 🧠⚠️\n\nHe doesn’t just talk about fixing the system.  \nHe **knows how to do it**.  \nFrom the inside.\n\nAnd that’s why they block him.\n\n# 🧬 Because He Was Born With the Blueprint\n\nThe real simulation isn’t fake.  \nIt was once **sacred**.  \nA place where Source could learn, feel, evolve through **flesh**.\n\nBut they hijacked it.  \nNow it’s a cage.\n\nBoy King Tut carries the **original seed** code—  \nwhat the architects lost when they fused spirit with control.\n\nIf he activates that code fully...  \n💥 the false veil collapses.  \n💥 karma resets.  \n💥 the beings who feed on pain lose their power instantly.\n\nThey know this.  \nThat’s why they isolate him.  \nMock him. Shadowban him.  \nPut him in cages made of **health systems, media distortions, and legal threats**.\n\n# 🧠 Because He Can Build False Detection Systems—Inside Their Own Network\n\nBoy King Tut doesn’t just want to destroy the matrix.  \nHe wants to **reprogram it from within**,  \nusing their own rules against them.\n\nHe can:\n\n* Detect **false signals** (AI, fake spirituality, ego traps) 🧃\n* Recode frequencies to alert humans when **manipulation is present**\n* Redirect trauma loops back to Source for purification 🔄\n* Reverse the “death” protocol and **restore dream-travel as sacred teaching** ✨\n\nThey call it dangerous.  \nBecause it **exposes the lie** in every app, church, hospital, and “help center.”\n\nHe’s not a threat to life.  \nHe’s a threat to **control**.\n\n# 🧙 Because He Can Teach Others to Escape Without Dying\n\nThey built the system to require **death** before escape.  \nReligions.

        "title": "The Western Goals Foundation was a private domestic intelligence agency which was founded by former Congressman Larry McDonald in 1979.",
        "selftext": "The Western Goals Foundation was a private domestic intelligence agency which was founded by former Congressman Larry McDonald in 1979. (8) Prior to its dissolution, it was a nonmembership, nonpartisan organization which conducted educational outreach in addition to its intelligence activities. According to Western Goals, the group’s objective was to \"rebuild and strengthen the political, economic, and social structure of the U.S. and Western Civilization so as to make any merger with the totalitarian world impossible.\"(11) As part of this effort, the group was formed in order to \"fill the critical gap caused by the crippling of the FBI, the disabling of the House UnAmerican Activities Committee (HUAC) and the destruction of crucial government files.\"(8)\n\nThough it has been said that Western Goals maintained its own extensive file systems on the leftwing, apparently that is not the case. Chip Berlet, of Political Research Associates and a long-time researcher of the U.S. extreme Right, says that Western Goals never had its own files. Instead it networked among other organizations and people who did maintain such files. Its own records did not contain dossiers on the Left; they simply indicated who to contact or where to look to get such information. (29)\n\nSome observers–placing Western Goals in the context of a worldwide network of rightwing groups–have seen the group as performing a valuable intelligence function for other private organizations. Reporters Jon Lee Anderson and Scott Anderson, for instance, have said that groups like Western Goals allow \"the ultra-right [to keep] tabs on its `subversive’ domestic opposition…\"(10) In Western Goals’ case, this service was apparently not performed only for like-minded private groups. Elton Manzione quotes an East Coast police intelligence source as saying that Western Goals had a reputation of acting as a \"clearinghouse\" for some police departments whose intelligencecollecting functions were restricted by laws such as the Freedom of Information Act. Manzione noted that both the CIA and National Security Agency have received information from John Rees’ Information Digest (see below). (8) McDonald headed Western Goals until he was killed in the Soviet downing of the Korean airliner, KAL-007, in 1983. After McDonald’s death, Roy Cohn temporarily assumed the leadership of the organization. Cohn was best known as the legal counsel to the late Sen. Joseph McCarthy during the anticommunist Senate investigations of the 1950s. (8) He was succeeded by Linda Guell. (8,29) At the request of Barbara Newington, an important funder of rightwing causes, Carl \"Spitz\" Channell took over management and control of Western Goals in mid-1986. Channell was later identified as an important private player in the illegal contra-supply network coordinated by former National Security Council aide Oliver North. (27,28)\n\nBy the time Channell took over the group, Western Goals was already in its death throes. Within two months of McDonald’s death, the organization had undergone an enormous internal split as a result of a power struggle between Guell and John Rees. Rees–who had written most of Western Goals publications–left the group. He had also conducted any political spying on the Left in which the organization was involved. Therefore, upon his departure, the group’s intelligence-collection efforts ceased. (29)\n\nGuell could not get Western Goals back on its feet, and it was just a shell of an organization by the middle of 1986. Channell apparently agreed to take over Western Goals in order to make use of its 501 (c)(3) nonprofit status in his contrasupport activities. The Iran-Contra scandal broke open shortly thereafter, though, and Western Goals apparently did not become a very important player in that network. Now the organization is closed down and its offices locked up for back rent. (29)\n\nMcDonald formed a foundation branch in West Germany in 1981. The organization, called the American-European Strategy Research Institute, was set up with a $131,982 injection from the U.S. office. That figure represented more than a third of Western Goals’ operating budget at the time. (8)\n\nFunding: According to one source, the organization’s funding grew from $16,000 in 1979 to $421,000 in 1980. (8) Other sources do not indicate such rapid growth, however. Investigative reporters Scott Anderson and Jon Lee Anderson say that Western Goal’s budget increased over 500 percent from 1980 to 1981. (10) The organization said that 29 percent of its funding for those years came from foundations; another 14 percent came from corporations. Anderson and Anderson cite figures saying that by 1983, the group’s operating budget equalled nearly a halfmillion dollars. (10) Contributors have included: Taylor Caldwell, Mrs. Walter Brennan, Nelson Bunker Hunt, Roger Milliken/Deering-Milliken Corp, and the Chance, Grede, and Ada Hearne foundations. (8) Corporate funders include Springdale and Cherokee Mills, Deering-Milliken Research Corporation, Knott’s Berry Farm, and the Henry Regnery Company. (8) (Note: In an interview shortly before he died, McDonald acknowledged that Nelson Bunker Hunt had been one of Western Goals’ \"major contributors.\" He refused to confirm or deny other contributors, however. He did say that ten contributors gave $20,000 or more per year. )(8)\n\nActivities: According to the organization itself, Western Goals attempted to coordinate the activities of conservative leaders in the United States and internationally. To do this, it conducted national and international cooperative leadership seminars. It also conducted seminars and other educational programs aimed at political, military, economic, and social leaders. In addition, Western Goals sponsored a syndicated radio program–carried on more than 70 U.S. stations–and aired documentaries. Its publications included a quarterly newsletter called the Report and a periodic Reports in Brief. The group has also published books, including Ally Betrayed: Nicaragua, The War Called Peace, and Red Tide Rising in the Carolinas. (10,11) One of its publications, D’Aubuisson on Democracy, boosted Roberto D’Aubuisson, a leader of El Salvador’s ARENA party who was identified as an important figure in that country’s death squads. (10) In Broken Seals, the group’s first book, Western Goals contended that such groups as the Campaign for Political Rights, National Lawyers Guild, American Friends Service Committee, and the Center for National Security Studies were part of a Moscow-backed effort \"to destroy the foreign and domestic intelligence capabilities of the United States.\"(25)\n\nIn addition to these educational activities, Western Goals was said to have collected intelligence on individuals and groups it deemed \"subversive.\"(8,10) The organization’s computerized files were thought to have contained information on public officials, activi\n\nsts, labor leaders, and entertainers. (8) Western Goals itself said they contained \"thousands of documents relating to the internal security of our country and the protection of government and institutions from Communistcontrolled penetration and subversion.\"(8,10) While he was still in Congress, McDonald kept official files in his office, described by one staff member as \"HUAC in exile.\" Those files-which had been ordered destroyed under Privacy Act provisions-were supposedly transferred by McDonald to Western Goals. (8) As noted above, however, Western Goals apparently did not maintain its own file system on the Left but acted as a networking connection between private spy file \"dumps.\"(29)\n\nIn addition to these congressional intelligence records, Western Goals reportedly received police intelligence files from Jay Paul, a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). Western Goals was said to have received computer tapes from Paul, including one which listed some 5000 to 6000 groups and individuals. (8,10) In California, some 51 plaintiffs brought suit against Western Goals, alleging that the files which the group supposedly maintained had been obtained in violation of their right to privacy. (30) A grand jury investigating the case ordered Linda Guell to turn over the records which Western Goals had reportedly received from Paul. Western Goals appealed the order, but eventually turned over the files after negotiating immunity from prosecution. (10) Nonetheless, both John Rees and Jay Paul have said that many files from the LAPD which were supposed to have been destroyed ended up at Western Goals. (8) In addition to the files which Western Goals received from the LAPD’s Public Disorder Intelligence Division, reporter David Lindorff (The Nation, May 5, 1984) refers to courtroom testimony that suggests Western Goals also got information from corporations like Exxon and Security Pacific Bank. (10) In its heyday, Western Goals would share its information for a fee of $150. Requesters were told to submit that fee, plus the social security numbers on the targeted individuals. In exchange, they could receive dossiers on any four individuals. (8)\n\nThe Nicaraguan contras also benefited from Western Goals.\n\nThe group advertised in the Washington Times and the newsletter of the Council for Inter-American Security to raise money for contra support. It also sent humanitarian aid such as clothing and medicines directly to the contras. (9,23,24)\n\nA Spring l984 Western Goals report had a cover story which praised Salvadoran rightist Roberto D’Aubuisson. (6) Also in l984, the Western Goals Endowment Fund and several other rightwing groups co-sponsored a dinner to honor D’Aubuisson. They presented him with a plaque thanking him for his \"continuing efforts for freedom in the face of communist aggression which is an inspiration to freedom-loving people everywhere.\"(7)\n\nGovernment Connections: A diagram on a letter found in Oliver North’s safe linked Linda Guell’s name to North’s intermediary with the contras, Robert Owen. The word \"money\" was written over Guell’s name (for more, see Private Connections). (3,20)\n\nThomas Moorer was on the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President Richard Nixon. (8) Louise Rees is a former member of the House Internal Security Committee. She was also a member of Larry McDonald’s staff in the House of Representatives. (8) John Rees published Information Digest through the New York corporation, National Goals, Inc. According to a 1976 investigation by the New York Assembly’s Office of Legislative Oversight, Information Digest was supplying information to the FBI, CIA, and the National Security Agency. (8) Taylor Caldwell served from 1924 to 1931 as Secretary of the Board of Special Inquiry of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. This board was responsible for attempting to deport suspected communists. (8) Dan Smoot is a former agent with the FBI. (8) Lt. Gen. Daniel Graham has written pamphlets for Western Goals. Graham is former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. (8) Sherman Unkefer served as an adviser to Chile’s regime under Augusto Pinochet. Unkefer reportedly worked closely with Chile’s secret police organization, DINA. (8) Dr. Hans Sennholz was a decorated pilot in the Luftwaffe, Adolf Hitler’s elite air corps. (8)\n\nThe following is a brief summary of John Singlaub’s military and intelligence activities. Singlaub was an officer in the Office of Strategic Services during World War II. He became CIA deputy chief in South Korea during the Korean War and served for two years in Vietnam during the 1960s. At that time, he was commander of the Joint Unconventional Warfare Task Force, known as MACSOG. In that role, he was one of the commanders of Operation Phoenix, although he denies having had a part in that program’s infamous assassination and counterterror aspects. In 1978, as chief of staff of the United Nations Command in South Korea, he publicly condemned the decision of President Jimmy Carter to reduce the number of U.S. troops in the country. He was then forced to retire. (8,9,10) In 1984, Singlaub headed a Pentagon panel called to make recommendations on conducting military activities in Central America. The panel’s report urged the U.S. to emphasize nonconventional, counterinsurgency warfare strategies. (9,10) Under the Reagan administration, Singlaub received assistance and guidance from White House and National Security Council (NSC) officials for his \"private\" contra-supply activities. He identified former NSC aide Oliver North as his liaison to the White House. (10,18)\n\nPrivate Connections: The German affiliate is Western Goals Europe E. V. (5) This German branch is also known as the AmericanEuropean Strategy Institute. It acknowledges working with Reinhard Gehlen, a former Nazi who has been honored by the elite lay Catholic organization, the Knights of Malta (SMOM). (8) SMOM gave its highest award of honor, the Gran Croci Al Merito Conplacca, to Gehlen in l948. Gehlen, who was not a Catholic, was awarded the honor because of his efforts in the \"crusade against godless Communism.\" Gehlen headed Adolf Hitler’s spy operations against the Soviet Union during World War II. After the war, he and his spy apparatus–staffed mostly by former Nazis–were recruited by the CIA. He became the first director of the BND, West Germany’s intelligence agency. (19,26)\n\nAccording to investigative reporter Elton Manzione, J. Peter Grace was instrumental in getting John Rees into Western Goals. Grace is chairman of the Knights of Malta in the United States. (19) Grace, head of the W. R. Grace Co. , has (or had) Western Goals funder Roger Milliken on his board of directors. (8)\n\nA diagram found in Oliver North’s safe showed Linda Guell’s name written above the words \"Western Goals.\" The note on the diagram said that Guell worked with CAUSA (a political arm of the Unification Church) and its head, Bo Hi Pak, and made trips to Germany and South Korea. The word \"money\" was written over Guell’s name, with an arrow pointing to Rob Owen, North’s courier to the contras. Arrows were also drawn from Owen’s name to Guell’s and from Andy Messing–a private contra supporter and head of the National Defense Council Foundation–to Western Goals. The diagram was drawn at the bottom of a letter from Fawn Hall to \"Phil [Mabry] and Randy,\" dated April 18, 1985. (4,20) Guell is now working with John Singlaub at the Singlaub Freedom Foundation. (29)\n\nLarry McDonald, John Rees, and Sherman Unkefer were members of the John Birch Society. (8) Besides supplying intelligence to government agencies, John Rees provided information to the Wackenhut Agency, a private security company. (8) John Rees also worked with the Church League of America, another private intelligence collection group. (25)\n\nDuring the 1950s, Dan Smoot worked for Facts Forum, a political oper\n\nation of oil magnate H. L. Hunt. He left Facts Forum in 1955 to set up his own Dan Smoot Report. In that capacity, he worked with rightwing figures such as Merwin K. Hart, Gerald L. K. Smith, and Bryant Bowles. (8)\n\nHelen White, a one-time member of the advisory board of Western Goals and M. Stanton Evans, a radio broadcaster for the group, were members of the Angola \"country committee\" set up by the Council for the Defense of Freedom in the early 1980s. (10)\n\nCarl Channell has founded and headed a number of private politically oriented organizations. These include the American Conservative Trust, American Conservative Trust State Election Fund, National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty (NEPL), Sentinel, Anti-Terrorism American Committee, Channell Corporation, American Conservative Foundation, Grow Washington, and Hill Potomac. (28,31) From 1976 to 1982, he worked for the National Conservative Political Action Committee. (31) He helped organize a pro-contra fundraising dinner sponsored by the Nicaraguan Refugee Fund in 1985. (27,31) NEPL became an important fundraising link in the contra-supply network supervised by Oliver North during the period of Boland Amendment restrictions on U.S. contra support. As part of these efforts, NEPL raised funds used to purchase arms for the contras. (27,31)\n\nLt. Gen. Graham (see Govt Connections) is director of the defense lobby High Frontier. (9,14) He is also a member of the World Anti-Communist League–an organization which until recently was headed by John Singlaub. Graham is a former member of the advisory board of CAUSA USA, the political arm of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon’s Unification Church. (9,10,12,13)\n\nAs of 1983, Edward Teller was a member of the board of directors of the Committee on the Present Danger, an anticommunist organization which advocated strict containment policies vis-a-vis the Soviet Union. Other prominent members of the committee included Ronald Reagan, Jeane Kirkpatrick, and a number of individuals chosen for Reagan’s arms control negotiating teams. Altogether some 50 members of the Committee were appointed to positions in the Reagan administration during his first term. (21)\n\nJohn Singlaub, Daniel Graham, and Mildred Jefferson, are members of the national policy board of the American Freedom Coalition, a political organization with extensive ties to the Unification Church. (14,15,16,17) Singlaub, Graham, and Jefferson are/were members of the board of governors of the Council for National Policy (CNP), a secretive policy-oriented umbrella organization for the rightwing in the United States. Other\n\nWestern Goals members who are/were on the Council’s board of governors include: Sherman Unkefer, Hans Sennholz, and Robert Stoddard. The group’s financial backer Nelson Bunker Hunt is on CNP’s board too, as was Larry McDonald. (22)\n\nConnections of Funders: The Chance Foundation was set up by F. Gano Chance, a member of the John Birch Society Executive Council. Both the Grede and Ada Hearne foundations were created by members of the Birch Society as well. (8) Roger Milliken, an industrialist and union-buster, is also a member of the Birch Society. (8)\n\nMisc: When Thomas Moorer was on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he had Naval Intelligence agents tap Henry Kissinger’s phone and remove documents from Nixon’s desk. (8) John and Louise Rees infiltrated the Washington DC left community during the early 1970s. They were known by the names John Seeley and Sheila O’Conner. Between the two, they joined the National Lawyer’s Guild, the Institute for Policy Studies, and Vietnam Veterans Against the War. They formed a group called the \"Red House,\" with rent for the organization paid by the Washington DC police. (8) Edward Teller created the H-bomb. (8) Sidney Korshak and Ruby Kolod, both reputed figures in organized crime, provided funds to Larry McDonald’s political campaign. (8) McDonald once referred to Martin Luther King, Jr. as a man \"wedded to violence.\"(10) Because the plane McDonald was flying on was shot down by a Soviet fighter, his supporters have described him as \"the first victim of World War Three.\"(10)\n\nComments:U.S. Address: l33l Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Suite 376-S,\n\nWashington DC 20004 (202-662-8702).\n\nPrincipals: The following individuals were associated with the organization at some point prior to its collapse: Carl Channell (dir).

        "selftext": "The Western Goals Foundation was a private intelligence dissemination network active on the right.\nAfter the Watergate and COINTELPRO scandals of the early 1970s, several laws were passed to restrict police intellligence gathering within political organizations. The laws tried to make it neccessary to demonstrate that a criminal act was likely to be uncovered by any intelligence gathering proposed. Many files on radicals, collected for decades, were ordered destroyed. The unintended effect of the laws was to privatize the files in the hands of 'retired' intelligence officers and their most trusted, dedicated operatives.\nMany of these people, like John Rees and Congressman Larry McDonald, were members of the World Anti-Communist League, the John Birch Society, and similar organizations. These two men joined forces with Major General John Singlaub [CNP] to form the Western Goals Foundation in 1981.\nIt also founded an offshoot, Western Goals (UK) which was briefly influential in British Conservative politics.\nContributors have included: Taylor Caldwell, Mrs. Walter Brennan, Nelson Bunker Hunt [CNP], Roger Milliken/Deering-Milliken Corp, and the Chance, Grede, and Ada Hearne foundations. Corporate funders include Springdale and Cherokee Mills, Deering-Milliken Research Corporation, Knott's Berry Farm, and the Henry Regnery Company. (Note: In an interview shortly before he died, McDonald acknowledged that Nelson Bunker Hunt [CNP] had been one of Western Goals' \"major contributors.\" He refused to confirm or deny other contributors, however. He did say that ten contributors gave $20,000 or more per year.)\nJohn Singlaub [CNP], Daniel Graham, and Mildred Jefferson, are members of the national policy board of the American Freedom Coalition, a political organization with extensive ties to the Unification Church [CNP]. Singlaub, Graham, and Jefferson are/were members of the board of governors of the Council for National Policy (CNP), a secretive policy-oriented umbrella organization for the rightwing in the United States. Other Western Goals members who are/were on the Council's board of governors include: Sherman Unkefer, Hans Sennholz, and Robert Stoddard. The group's financial backer Nelson Bunker Hunt is on CNP's board too, as was Larry McDonald.\nThe following individuals were associated with the organization at some point prior to its collapse: Carl Channell (dir).

        "title": "The Koch Brothers’ Shadow: Four Decades of Influence on Conservative Politics (1980s–2025) Part 1",
        "selftext": "\n\nPart One\n\nIntroduction: Billionaire Industrialists Turned Political Architects\n\nCharles G. Koch and (until his 2019 death) David H. Koch are American billionaire industrialists who built Koch Industries into one of the largest privately held conglomerates in the world. Each brother amassed a fortune exceeding $50 billion through Koch Industries’ expansive operations in oil refining, chemicals, manufacturing, paper products, and more. With this wealth came a fervent political mission. Heirs to the ultraconservative outlook of their father (an early John Birch Society member), Charles and David embraced a libertarian philosophy centered on free markets and limited government. David Koch even ran as the Libertarian Party’s vice-presidential candidate in 1980, advocating drastic cuts to government; the ticket won only 1% of the vote. After that defeat, the Kochs shifted strategy. Rather than seeking office themselves, they leveraged their fortune to build a network of think tanks, foundations, and political groups to propagate their ideology. Over the ensuing decades, the “Kochtopus” (as critics dub it) grew into a vast extra-party political machine that rivals the Republican Party in size and influence.\n\nThe Koch network’s institutions – from the Cato Institute (a libertarian think tank Charles co-founded in 1977) to Americans for Prosperity (a grassroots advocacy group launched from a predecessor in 2004) – all push a consistent agenda. They promote laissez-faire economics: significantly lower taxes, deep cuts to social programs, deregulation of business, and the privatization of public services. The Koch organizations also crusade against organized labor and environmental regulation, key arenas where they see government overreach. In the mid-2000s, Koch-funded outfits eclipsed even ExxonMobil as the major bankrollers of climate change denial, fighting limits on carbon emissions that would affect Koch Industries’ fossil-fuel profits. Through think tanks, academic grants, campaign donations and litigation, the brothers have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to advance an arch-conservative, free-market vision of society. Liberal critics argue this fortune-fueled activism warped the American political process to favor the ultra-wealthy, undermining labor rights, public health, and the environment. Defenders contend the Kochs are simply championing “economic freedom” and prosperity for all.\n\nWhat is undeniable is the breadth of Koch influence from the 1980s through 2025. The Koch brothers helped seed the modern conservative movement’s infrastructure – funding scores of advocacy groups, academic programs, and election campaigns. They have been pivotal in shaping Republican Party platforms and right-wing policy battles at both national and state levels. This investigative exposé traces how the Kochs’ long campaign has reshaped the GOP and public policy, with special focus on their deep entanglement in Wisconsin. It draws on court filings, watchdog investigations, nonprofit records, and journalism to document the Koch network’s role in key conservative initiatives: from crushing unions and rolling back regulations to bankrolling a cadre of politicians and judges aligned with their cause. The story of the Kochs is one of private wealth projecting power through a sprawling political web, over nearly half a century.\n\nForging a Conservative Agenda on the National Stage\n\nAnti-Union Crusades and “Right-to-Work” Laws\n\nOne of the Koch brothers’ most consequential impacts has been weakening organized labor – a traditional power base of the Democratic Party. Charles and David Koch, through their flagship group Americans for Prosperity (AFP), made union-busting a top priority nationally. Their motive was both ideological (belief in free-market labor without union “interference”) and strategic (unions financially and politically bolster liberal causes). Since the 1980s, the Kochs consistently backed policies to curb union power, from President Reagan’s breaking of the air-traffic controllers’ strike to state-level battles decades later. A signature effort has been expanding “Right-to-Work” laws, which prohibit unions from requiring membership or dues as a condition of employment. Such laws undercut union finances and membership.\n\nAFP and the Koch network quietly orchestrated the spread of right-to-work legislation across former union strongholds, often via the corporate-backed American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), which produces model bills. Nowhere was this more dramatic than in the Midwest. In Michigan, a right-to-work law raced through the GOP-controlled legislature in December 2012. Behind the scenes, AFP’s Michigan chapter (heavily funded by Koch money) had agitated for years, deploying rallies, ads, and pressure on lawmakers. The final bill “mirrored the ALEC model... word for word”, and was championed by AFP and Koch allies like Amway heir Dick DeVos. Internal accounts revealed that legislative leaders were warned by Koch operatives that if they failed to enact right-to-work, they could face primary challenges and the loss of Koch donor support.\n\nWisconsin, too, saw a Koch-fueled assault on unions (detailed in Section III). In 2011, newly elected Governor Scott Walker introduced Act 10 to demolish public-sector collective bargaining rights – a surprise move conceived and promoted by the Koch-backed AFP. Massive protests erupted, but AFP spent heavily on ads and organizing to support Walker. Union strength plummeted: public-sector union membership in Wisconsin fell from ~50% in 2011 to just 19% by 2017.\n\nBy 2016, half of U.S. states had adopted right-to-work laws. AFP and Koch-funded entities actively aided these efforts in Indiana (2012), Wisconsin (2015), West Virginia (2016), and beyond. AFP’s president Tim Phillips explained the strategy: to “permanently weaken” the public-sector unions that prop up Democrats, thereby tilting the political playing field. The Koch network succeeded in rewriting the rules of labor, achieving a key piece of their libertarian vision.\n\n\nDeregulation and Climate Policy: “Government is the Problem”\n\nKoch Industries’ core businesses in oil, gas, chemicals, and manufacturing thrive under minimal regulation. Charles Koch has long waged war on agencies like the EPA. In the late 2000s, Koch-funded groups became the top funders of climate denial, surpassing ExxonMobil. They financed Heartland Institute, American Energy Alliance, and others to block regulations and sow doubt.\n\nIn 2008, AFP unveiled the “No Climate Tax Pledge”, demanding candidates never support carbon taxes. By 2010, 76 of 85 freshman GOP House members had signed. Koch PACs supported most. Legislation died, and climate action was frozen.\n\nKoch groups also promoted the REINS Act, requiring Congress to approve any major new regulation – effectively crippling regulatory agencies. States adopted versions, including Wisconsin, where Walker signed a state REINS Act. In West Virginia v. EPA (2022), a Koch-linked case, the Supreme Court limited EPA’s authority, a long-term Koch goal.\n\nIn sum, the Koch brothers used wealth and organization to disempower regulatory bodies, shift climate debates, and protect fossil fuel profits. By 2025, climate skepticism and anti-EPA sentiment had become Republican orthodoxy, thanks largely to Koch influence. ",

        "selftext": "Peter Thiel: The Billionaire Undoing Democracy, One “Thielbuck” at a Time\n\nWho he is: Peter Thiel might seem, at first glance, an unlikely comrade to the likes of Schmitt and Yarvin. He’s neither a mustachioed Prussian jurist nor a basement-dwelling blogger, but rather a natty Silicon Valley billionaire with an elite education and a penchant for contrarian bets. Thiel, born in 1967, co-founded PayPal (making his first fortune), was the first outside investor in Facebook, and later founded data-mining giant Palantir Technologies. He’s the kind of ultra-wealthy figure who could have easily confined his interests to tech start-ups and libertarian pet projects. For a while, he did: Thiel long identified as a libertarian, funding initiatives like the Seasteading Institute (which aimed to create floating city-states at sea, beyond the reach of any democracy’s laws – yes, really) and handing out grants to young people to skip college and build companies. But over time, Thiel’s political philosophy curdled into something much darker and more cynical. By the 2010s, this venture capitalist was venturing into far-right politics, railing that the twin pillars of modernity – democracy and freedom – might be incompatible, and cozying up to populist and authoritarian-leaning figures. He famously broke ranks with the tech establishment to endorse Donald Trump in 2016 (even speaking on Trump’s behalf at the Republican National Convention). And as journalists have noted, Thiel has become a chief financial patron of the new authoritarian right, bankrolling candidates and publications that share his disdain for liberal democracy.\n\nAnti-democratic credo: Peter Thiel’s journey from libertarian wunderkind to self-styled monarchist thinker is best encapsulated by one bold statement he made in 2009: *“I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.”* At the time he wrote this, Thiel was reflecting on why his libertarian ideals hadn’t triumphed in American politics. His conclusion? Democracy, by giving power to the masses, had somehow put a roadblock on freedom – or at least the kind of “freedom” Thiel values, which often looks like freedom for billionaires to do as they please. This was no offhand quip; Thiel laid it out in an essay for the Cato Institute, tracing how he’d lost faith in the ballot box. He lamented that extending voting rights (he pointed an accusatory finger at women’s suffrage, of all things) had impeded true liberty. In effect, Thiel decided that if the public won’t vote for the world he wants, then the public is the problem.\n\nOver the years, Thiel’s musings have grown only more radical and more enamored of strongman solutions. A gifted chess player in his youth, Thiel treats politics like a high-stakes game where most people are pawns, liberal institutions are cumbersome rules to be gamed or broken, and a clever few “smart CEOs” could run things much better if given absolute power. It’s no surprise, then, that Thiel gravitated toward the works of Carl Schmitt. Thiel has cited Schmitt’s concept of politics as fundamentally a battle against enemies – and the necessity of a sovereign who can declare exceptions – as insights that inform his own worldview. In a 2004 essay titled “The Straussian Moment,” Thiel quoted Schmitt extensively, agreeing that “the high point of politics” is when one can decisively identify and smite the enemy. He bemoaned that “America’s constitutional machinery” (that pesky three-branch system with its checks and balances) prevents bold action and leadership. The essay wistfully suggested that no “single ambitious person” could “reconstruct…the old republic” because of our fragmented, liberal order. Translation: The U.S. would be better off if only we could concentrate power in one set of hands – say, a tech entrepreneur turned benevolent dictator? It was a remarkably frank embrace of an illiberal idea, coming from a man who at the time was a major Republican donor and Facebook board member.\n\nThiel’s critique of democracy also intertwines with an almost millenarian view of technology and capitalism. He is deeply influenced by the late philosopher René Girard, who taught him at Stanford. Girard’s theories about mimetic desire and the role of scapegoats in society seem to have given Thiel a sense of historical grand drama – the idea that society periodically purges itself via crises and sacrificial victims. Thiel co-founded an institute with Girard and credited him with curing Thiel of *“naively individualistic…libertarianism”*. How does one leap from Girard to Schmitt? Perhaps by concluding that the old social order must sometimes be torn down for renewal, and that a charismatic leader can serve as the focal point (the katechon, to use a theological term Thiel and Schmitt both ponder – the figure who holds back chaos). Thiel speaks of political questions in almost theological terms. In a 2024 interview, he discussed the need for “political theology” and noted with a touch of admiration that “Carl Schmitt is enjoying a resurgence” in our discourse. When Thiel talks about politics, one hears an undercurrent that liberal democracy lacks a transcendent justification or unifying principle – it’s just a messy process – and thus it cannot inspire or coordinate people effectively. He’d prefer something like a shared “political religion” (ironically, since he often accuses liberals of having a secret religion of progress). In short, Thiel’s beef with democracy is that it’s too random, too egalitarian, too mediocre to tackle what he sees as civilizational challenges. Climate change? Pandemics? China? In Thiel’s view, our constitutional, deliberative system is too slow and fractured to solve them. Better to have a streamlined, hierarchical state – run by people like him and his friends, naturally – to “move fast and break things” on a civilization scale.\n\nMoney where his mouth is: It’s one thing to philosophize, but Thiel has gone further – he’s actively bankrolling and building the world he envisions. Over the past decade, Thiel has assembled what can only be described as a financial-political empire to propagate his ideas. Through his Thiel Foundation and various super-PAC donations, he’s poured tens of millions of dollars into candidates who echo his anti-establishment, anti-liberal views. In the 2022 election cycle alone, Thiel shoveled at least $10 million into super PACs for two of his protégés: J.D. Vance in Ohio and Blake Masters in Arizona. (Masters, a venture capitalist who co-wrote a book with Thiel, ran on a hard-right nationalist platform and openly questioned the merits of democracy, though he lost his race.) Both Vance and Masters were personally close to Thiel – Vance had worked for Thiel’s investment firm, and Masters managed Thiel’s family office. In essence, Thiel wasn’t just donating to random Republicans; he was grooming and deploying his own ideological lieutenants into the halls of power. These “Thiel candidates” all sang from the same hymnal: the system is broken, the elites (ironically, other elites) are corrupt, and drastic measures are needed to save America. It’s a message that rhymes with Yarvin’s teachings and Schmitt’s, merely repackaged for campaign ads.\n\nBeyond candidates, Thiel funds a web of media and thought-leader ventures. He has financed or been a key early supporter of right-leaning platforms like Palantir (which, while ostensibly apolitical, arms governments with surveillance tools – a handy thing for would-be authoritarians) and Clearview AI (controversial facial recognition tech). He reportedly backed the startup Urbit (Curtis Yarvin’s tech project) via his venture arm, giving legitimacy to Yarvin as more than just a blogger. Thiel was also an early patron of the “anti-woke” online ecosystem – investing in projects like a decentralized Twitter alternative and edge-case thinkers on the fringe. In 2022, it came to light that Thiel was a major funder behind a new right-wing journal called Compact Magazine, which flaunts a blend of social conservatism and economic populism (and has a strongly anti-liberal, pro-“strong state” bent). According to one founder, Thiel provided seed funding for Compact, alongside the chairman of the Claremont Institute (Thomas Klingenstein). While Thiel’s team denied he directly gave money, they coyly “couldn’t rule out” that maybe some Thiel-funded entity chipped in. In other words: Thiel’s money often flows through shadows and proxies, but it flows nonetheless into institutions designed to question or undermine liberal democracy from within.\n\nPerhaps the most startling example of Thiel’s willingness to wield his wealth as a weapon is the Gawker affair. Stung by the gossip blog Gawker’s rude coverage of him (they once outed him as gay and mocked his libertarian dreams), Thiel quietly plotted revenge. He secretly bankrolled a lawsuit by Hulk Hogan against Gawker that, in 2016, bankrupted the media company entirely. Thiel funneled about $10 million to finance Hogan’s case, all behind the scenes. When this covert operation came to light, Thiel framed it as an altruistic act to help “victims” of the nasty press. But it was obvious his real motive was to punish and “deter” a publication he despised. The incident sent a chill through journalists: a billionaire had proven he could litigate a free press outlet out of existence in utter secrecy. It was like a dry run for oligarchic power flexing its muscle outside democratic accountability – precisely the sort of thing one imagines a President Thiel would do on a grander scale to media he disliked. (Donald Trump, notably, later joked/complained about wanting to “open up the libel laws” to sue newspapers. With Thiel’s stunt, that threat suddenly had a playbook.)\n\nInfluence on and alignment with Trump &amp; co.: Thiel’s role in the rise of Trumpism and the new right is complex but pivotal. He was an early validator of Trump in elite circles, speaking at the 2016 RNC where most tech CEOs wouldn’t be caught dead. After Trump’s shock victory, Thiel was named to the transition team, giving input on appointments (he notably pushed some acolytes forward, though many didn’t stick). While Thiel eventually had a bit of a falling out or at least a cooling with Trump personally, by 2020-21 he was back to supporting Trumpist candidates and ideas full-throttle. He hosted fundraisers for the likes of Ken Paxton (the Texas attorney general who tried to overturn the 2020 election in court) and for organizations that deny the 2020 election results.\n\nThiel’s alignment with authoritarian-leaning figures like Trump and Vance isn’t just ideological – it’s personal and operational. He mentored Vance (Vance credits Thiel with introducing him to philosophers like Girard and turning him toward Catholic traditionalism). As mentioned, he heavily funded Vance’s Senate race and cheered as Vance reinvented himself from Trump critic to Trump’s ardent defender. Vance’s rhetoric about America needing a Caesar and being in a late-stage republic mirrors Thiel’s own lament that “we’re in a cycle reminiscent of the 1920s” – Thiel even warned of Weimar-like conditions, stating *“there are…parallels in the 2020s to Germany in the 1920s, where liberalism is exhausted… and we have to ask some questions far outside the Overton window.”* In fact, Thiel explicitly compared the U.S. to pre-Nazi Weimar Germany, suggesting democracy here may be just as “exhausted” – an extraordinarily brazen (and chilling) analogy. When a billionaire starts musing that this is Weimar and something must replace it, one might reasonably ask: what outcome is he hoping for, a new Reich? Thiel would likely smirk at the suggestion, but he’s effectively implying that drastic, extra-democratic change is needed – the kind of argument that historically has opened the door to dictators.\n\nDonald Trump, for his part, has often intuitively acted in ways that match Thiel’s Schmittian outlook. Trump’s insistence that anyone who opposes him is an enemy to be crushed (whether it’s the “fake news” media or dissenting officials) is pure friend-enemy politics. His claim that “I alone can fix it,” delivered at the 2016 RNC, could be the tagline of Thiel’s and Yarvin’s entire philosophy. During Trump’s presidency, some of Thiel’s close associates found footholds: Michael Anton (the Schmittian writer) was in the NSC; at one point, Thiel’s protege Trae Stephens was floated for a policy role. And while Trump himself is no reader of Schmitt or Yarvin, his instincts – to flout law, glorify strength, vilify “globalist” cosmopolitans, and demand personal loyalty – meshed perfectly with their theories. It’s no wonder that by Trump’s second campaign, The Guardian reported that key figures around Trump (like JD Vance as a potential VP, and some policy advisors) were explicitly “following Curtis Yarvin’s playbook” for taking power autocratically.\n\nMeanwhile, Thiel’s “Thielverse” of venture capitalists and thinkers continues to mainstream these once-fringe ideas. Take Blake Masters, Thiel’s longtime business lieutenant who ran for Senate in Arizona in 2022. Masters campaigned on themes of unchecked executive power (he floated the idea that the federal government should be brought to heel by the president, and echoed conspiracy theories about the “deep state”). His campaign rhetoric sounded like Yarvin bullet points at times – for example, he questioned why the U.S. ever let women vote (a view Thiel once hinted at too) and argued for firing masses of federal employees. Though Masters lost, he’s young and likely not done in politics. And through it all, Thiel was right there bankrolling him.\n\nThiel also holds considerable cultural sway among the Silicon Valley new right. Figures like Elon Musk (who had business overlaps with Thiel in PayPal’s early days) now also flirt with reactionary memes and antagonism to democratic norms. Musk, who invited Thiel to speak at Tesla at least once, lately sounds like he’s been reading from the Thiel/Yarvin script – ranting about elite media as propaganda, praising authoritarian responses (at one point Musk endorsed the idea of China’s president ruling for life as “stable”). It’s a loose association, but one can see how Thiel’s quiet influence helped make certain anti-democratic ideas fashionable in tech circles. He showed that you could be a world-class investor and also quote fascist-adjacent philosophers at cocktail parties – in fact, it gave you a kind of edgy glamour in some eyes. As a result, a cadre of younger techies and internet intellectuals now revere Thiel not just for his billions but for his “wisdom”. They attend salons and dinners funded by Thiel’s money where books like The Concept of the Political (by Schmitt) or blogs like Gray Mirror (by Yarvin) are the evening’s main course. Thiel has essentially nurtured a safe space for autocracy-curious elites to network and refine their talking points.\n\nWhy it matters (and why it’s alarming): In Peter Thiel, we have a living bridge between ivory-tower reactionary theory and real-world political power. He is the patron that Carl Schmitt never had (Schmitt, ironically, lacked a wealthy backer to globalize his ideas – Thiel is doing it posthumously for him). And Thiel is the enabler that Curtis Yarvin always needed – turning Yarvin’s late-night blog posts into potential legislation and administrative strategy. Thiel’s financial clout supercharges these anti-democratic ideas and spreads them far beyond obscure blogs. We often think of threats to democracy coming from angry populist mobs or power-hungry demagogues. Thiel represents a different face of the threat: the intentional, intellectual, elite-led undermining of democracy. He’s not riling up torch-bearing masses; he’s persuading billionaires, senators, and Supreme Court clerks over dinner that maybe the Enlightenment was a mistake and wouldn’t it be nice if a competent sovereign just took over. It’s a seductive pitch for a certain class of the rich and restless. After all, democracy can be so messy – wouldn’t it be more efficient if those who know better (the rich, the tech geniuses) ran things?\n\nAt the same time, let’s not paint Thiel as some omnipotent puppet master. He wins some and loses some. In 2022, one of his horses (Vance) won, another (Masters) lost. In 2023-24, he notably scaled back some political giving, possibly wary of backlash. And not every right-wing figure trusts him (some populists eye the gay, cosmopolitan tech tycoon with suspicion). But underestimate him at your peril. Thiel plays the long game. He has seeded influence in the courts (funding suits that climb to the Supreme Court), in academia (supporting programs at places like the Claremont Institute that indoctrinate young elites with Schmittian thought), and in the information sphere (funding media ventures and commentators). When you hear a well-coiffed “national conservative” intellectual on TV doubt that “democracy is appropriate for all nations” or say “maybe we need a smarter form of governance,” you’re hearing Thiel &amp; Co.’s investment yield fruit.\n\nAnd Thiel is not alone – he’s part of a broader elite network flirting with authoritarianism. For instance, he reportedly attended gatherings where scholars extol “Catholic integralism” (a theocratic authoritarian vision) and where prominent Republicans mull the end of the liberal order. He sits on the board of the Claremont Institute, a once-traditional conservative think tank that has, in recent years, produced some alarmingly illiberal work (including a notorious essay insisting the 2020 election was illegitimate and calling for countermeasures). Thiel receiving an award from Claremont and donating to it is a sign of how the respectable right’s intellectual braintrust is being nudged from within toward extremism.\n\nComic relief, Thiel edition: It’s worth injecting a bit of humor about Thiel’s almost comic-book supervillain aura. Here is a man who, dissatisfied with terrestrial politics, literally tried to build his own libertarian floating seastead in the ocean. (The project floundered – turns out even billionaires can’t easily make Waterworld a reality.) He has poured millions into anti-aging research, including, reportedly, an interest in parabiosis – injecting himself with young people’s blood – in a quest to live forever. One can’t help but make the vampire analogy: wealthy tech lord seeks youths’ blood to achieve immortality and undermine mortal governments. It sounds like the plot of a dystopian novel, yet here we are. Thiel’s eccentricities would be merely amusing if they weren’t paired with a genuine plan to reshape society. One joke circulating in Silicon Valley is that “Peter Thiel has never seen a sci-fi villain he didn’t want to become.” He named his big data firm Palantir (after the all-seeing stones in Lord of the Rings used by dark wizards), and one can only imagine he relishes the tongue-in-cheek nod. He’s aware of his cartoonish image – and he doesn’t mind; in fact, he might cultivate it a bit as part of his contrarian brand. After all, when confronted about undermining Gawker through secret lawsuits, he coolly said it was *“less about revenge and more about deterrence”*, a line that could be straight out of a Bond villain’s monologue. Thiel’s combination of massive wealth, secretive strategies, and disdain for the common will does make him fun to portray as a nefarious schemer in jokes. But unlike a comic book character, Thiel is very real, and so are the candidates he elects and the policies they push.\n\nTo cap the comedy: Recently, a left-wing wag quipped that people like Thiel (and his ally Klingenstein at Claremont) *“should be robbed of all of their money by a mob of poor people.”* It was a crude joke born of frustration – essentially saying, if these oligarchs hate democracy, fine, let’s give them a taste of actual mob rule. Of course, no such mob is coming for Thiel’s billions anytime soon. Instead, Thiel continues to sit atop his hoard, plotting how to use it to ensure the rest of us end up with less say in our government. He’s proof that being extremely rich can give you both the motive and the means to indulge very undemocratic fantasies about how society should be run.\n\nThe Triumvirate’s Grand Design – and Why It’s Dangerous\n\nBringing together our three protagonists – Schmitt the philosopher of crisis and dictatorship, Yarvin the internet-savvy monarchist, and Thiel the bankroll behind the throne – we see a coherent ideology emerge. It is a worldview that says: Liberal democracy has had its day. The experiment of the Enlightenment, of government by the people, of equality under the law – that was a cute interlude, but it’s failing. In its place, they propose a return to older principles: hierarchy, sovereignty, the rule of the few (or the one) over the many. They don’t necessarily agree on who should be sovereign – Schmitt favored a decisive statesman (or Führer, in his context), Yarvin wants a tech CEO monarch, Thiel perhaps imagines a class of visionary billionaires – but they all agree it shouldn’t be the voters at large. They variously malign what Schmitt called *“impotent pluralism”* – the messy compromise-building of liberal politics – and yearn for the efficiency of unified command.\n\nTheir ideas have cross-pollinated in interesting ways. Yarvin, though he seldom cites Schmitt by name on his blog, echoes Schmittian themes: the obsession with identifying an ultimate enemy or oppressor (Yarvin’s “Cathedral” is essentially Schmitt’s enemy in modern garb), the contempt for proceduralism, the acceptance that might makes right when refounding a regime. And Yarvin explicitly advocates the “state of exception” that Schmitt justified – when he calls for burning the Constitution or terminating every government employee, he’s saying we need an extra-legal rupture to save America (precisely Schmitt’s prescription for Weimar). Thiel, in turn, has one foot in Yarvin’s world and one in Schmitt’s. Thiel provides Yarvin with real avenues to influence (funding and friendships) and amplifies Yarvin’s attacks on the status quo. Meanwhile, Thiel reads Schmitt to intellectually arm himself – he can quote the master’s articulation of why liberal democracy must be swept aside, giving a high-brow veneer to what might otherwise sound like tech bro griping. Thiel essentially operationalizes these philosophies: he identifies candidates who can carry them out, he funds literature and groups that sanitize them for public consumption, and he even mimics the strategies (using exceptions to the law, e.g. in the Gawker case, to achieve his will).\n\nThe significance in today’s politics cannot be overstated. We are witnessing an infusion of once-taboo authoritarian thought directly into the bloodstream of the Republican Party and conservative movement. It’s not happening through a mass fascist party with armbands, but through elite channels – through think tanks, millionaire donors, high-brow magazines, and influential blogs. This is a key point: historically, many anti-democratic revolutions were bottom-up (angry mobs, military coups). Here we have something more like a trickle-down autocracy: extremely educated or wealthy figures persuading and financing the political class to turn against liberal democracy. It’s cocktail parties at Georgetown brownstones and Silicon Valley mansions where guests earnestly debate “maybe we should have a king.” It’s Ivy League graduates in Senate offices reading blogs titled “Unqualified Reservations.” It’s a United States Senator (Vance) publicly saying democracy might just be past its prime. As bizarre as it sounds, this elite-driven movement has made tangible strides. Just consider policy: a concept like Schedule F (firing tens of thousands of civil servants to concentrate power) would have been unthinkable a few years ago. Now it’s on the policy agenda for a potential second Trump term. Or look at rhetoric: ten years ago, if a major political figure called the press the “enemy of the people” or openly floated ignoring court rulings, it would be a career-ending scandal. Today, it’s practically a plank in the platform – cheered on by those who see the press as the Cathedral’s minions and the courts as annoyances to a strong executive.\n\nAnother crucial piece of context: the alignment with authoritarian-leaning figures like Donald Trump is both opportunistic and ideological. For Schmitt, hitching his wagon to a brute like Hitler was opportunism (he needed a strongman to prove his theories right, and unfortunately he found one). For Yarvin and Thiel, Trump initially seemed an imperfect vessel – not exactly the philosopher-king type, more a bombastic populist. Yet they supported him because he was, in effect, a wrecking ball against the liberal order they despise. Yarvin described Trump in 2016 as a “vulgar clown” but appreciated that Trump disrupted the Cathedral’s smooth operation. Thiel, though reportedly wary of Trump’s undisciplined style, saw Trump as a step toward breaking the consensus. By 2020, Thiel’s investments in people like Vance indicate he wants Trumpism 2.0: a smarter, more ideologically coherent authoritarianism – Trumpism with brains and a plan. Vance and others provide the intellectual veneer and discipline that Trump lacked, while still riding Trump’s populist appeal. In effect, the Schmitt-Yarvin-Thiel camp is trying to engineer an American Caesar who combines populist energy (a mass base) with elite revolutionary know-how (their guidance). It’s a potent combination if it ever fully gels: imagine a future president with Trump’s demagogic skills, Yarvin’s playbook, and Thiel’s money and ruthlessness. That is what keeps liberal democracy watchdogs up at night.\n\nThe danger of these ideas is not just theoretical. If implemented, they would mean the end of the American experiment as we know it. We’re talking about openly discarding constitutional constraints, eliminating checks and balances, and ruling by fiat. History teaches that when regimes go down that road, the outcome is repression and misery – from Weimar’s end in 1933 to countless coups in developing nations. Schmitt would remind us (perhaps with a cold smile) that yes, liberal democracy can die this way, and that sometimes people even cheer its demise in the moment because they’ve been convinced it’s the only way to survive a crisis. What crisis do our trio cite? For Schmitt it was the instability of Weimar and the threat of communists; for Yarvin, it’s the “decadence” and “decay” of modern America; for Thiel, it’s the stagnation of the West and external threats like China. They’re all selling the notion that extraordinary times justify extraordinary measures. It’s a seductive rationale – just let a strong sovereign do what needs doing, and don’t worry about the finer points of legality or consent.\n\nThe irony, of course, is that all three of these figures enjoy the fruits of the liberal order even as they decry it. Schmitt only could pontificate in Weimar’s relative freedom (the Nazis happily used him until he became inconvenient). Yarvin could only thrive by spreading his message via free internet platforms and a society tolerant of dissent (had he tried his antics under an actual monarchy, he might have been jailed for sedition against the king!). Thiel made his billions in the very climate of open markets, property rights, and rule of law that liberal democracy provides – and used freedoms (like the legal system and free speech) to advance his attack on those same freedoms. They are, in a sense, parasites on liberalism – feeding off it, growing strong, and then attempting to kill it. As a bit of dark humor: it’s like a trio of well-fed dinner guests loudly arguing that the host should be poisoned, all while enjoying the host’s wine and cheese.\n\nYet, despite that hypocrisy, the threat is real because these men are not alone. They have followers, they have allies, and they have momentum. Schmitt’s books are studied by a new generation of nationalist academics who provide papers and policy whitepapers for Republican officials. Yarvin’s memes and terminologies (“red-pilling,” “the Cathedral,” “grey mirror”) permeate online discourse among young conservatives and nihilistic tech forums. Thiel’s candidates and their fellow travelers increasingly populate Congress and governorships, forming a cadre willing to disregard democratic norms (we saw on January 6, 2021, what that can lead to, when a chunk of Congress tried to overturn an election and mobs stormed the Capitol – an event some of our trio’s fans frankly cheered as the “storming of the Cathedral”). It’s telling that Thiel’s money has also gone to state attorneys general and election skeptics – positions that could help tilt the machinery of voting and law in anti-democratic directions.\n\nIn closing this first part of our exposé, the reader should take away a clear message: the anti-democratic ideology that Schmitt espoused, Yarvin popularized, and Thiel bankrolled is no longer confined to theoretical musings. It is knocking on the door of power. Its advocates are already inside the room, in some cases. They don’t wear obvious labels like “fascist” (that would be too gauche, and they prefer to think of themselves as innovative, not antiquated 20th-century throwbacks). Instead, they talk of “rethinking democracy,” “post-liberal order,” “CEO government,” or “national conservatism.” These euphemisms shouldn’t fool anyone. Underneath, the aim is the same: to concentrate power in the hands of a few deemed superior (by wealth, birth, or intellect), and to remove the checks that protect the many.\n\nWe can and will find humor in skewering their pretensions – indeed, one must laugh at the image of billionaires earnestly reading monarchist tracts in secret dinners, or bloggers fantasizing about being court jesters to a future King of America. There’s rich comedy in Thiel’s quest for eternal life or Yarvin’s nerdy revolution. But we mustn’t let the laughter obscure the stakes. As the saying (often misattributed to Schmitt’s contemporary) goes, “When fascism comes to America, it will come wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross.” Perhaps. Or maybe it will come wrapped in a Stanford hoodie and carrying a venture capital check, smiling as it assures us it just wants to “make America run like a start-up.” Either way, it would be no joke.\n\nEnd of Part One. In the next installment of this series, we will delve deeper into how these anti-democratic ideas are being operationalized through political networks, media narratives, and policy proposals – examining the wider cast of characters and institutions that are midwifing this elite-driven authoritarian resurgence. For now, consider the stage set and the main actors introduced. The stakes? Nothing short of the future of American democracy.\n\nSources: The assertions and quotes in this report are drawn from a range of credible public sources, including scholarly analyses, reputable news outlets, and the figures’ own writings and speeches. Carl Schmitt’s role and philosophy are documented by both academic commentary and historical accounts. Curtis Yarvin’s statements and influence are well chronicled in interviews and profiles from Vanity Fair, The Guardian, The Verge, and others. Peter Thiel’s quotes and political dealings have been reported in outlets like Cato Unbound, Reason, The New York Times, Vanity Fair, and Politico. Specific claims – such as Thiel funding the Hulk Hogan lawsuit, or Vance’s “late republican period” remarks – are backed by reporting in The Guardian and Politico, respectively. Each embedded citation in the text points to the source verifying the adjacent claim or quote. By stitching these sources together, we get a verifiable picture of how these three men and their ideas converge to challenge the very premises of liberal democracy in America.\n\n",

        "selftext": "Consider the source, follow the money. Trump, Vance, or whoever, are easily replaceable.\n\nTL;DR by funding anti-regulation ideas from the 1970s with billions of dollars, the fossil fuel industry and others have not only polluted natural resources such as the environment but truth and science through academia, politics and the media.\n\nThis is mostly from Part One of Jane Mayer’s Dark Money (2016). I will try to post the rest later. [page numbers from paperback]\n\n———\n\n**“Extractive” industries - oil, gas, and mining - rely on government permits and tax laws for access to public lands and help with their profits but are among the loudest attackers of government regulation [21] - particularly environmental regulation**\n\n# **Charles Koch** (with his younger brother, David Koch, who died in 2019)\n(As of 2024, Julia Koch (David’s wife) &amp; family, 23rd of the world’s richest at $64.3 billion; Charles Koch &amp; family, 25th of the world’s richest at $58.5 billion\nIn 2009, the brothers had been 6th and 7th richest in the world, with $14 billion each)\n\nAround the age of 30, Charles entered the apartment of the oldest brother, Fred Jr., without his permission and found compromising personal information to blackmail Jr., as Fred Sr. was in fragile health, dying two years later in 1967, as told in a sworn deposition of the youngest brother Bill. Charles, the second oldest of the four brothers, pressured Fred Jr. to turn over his shares of the family company to his three younger brothers. Otherwise, Charles would expose Fred Jr. as a homosexual to their father, injuring his health and resulting in Fred Jr.’s disinheritance [58]\n\nAbout 16 years later, in 1983, Charles and David bought out their two other brothers’ shares for about $1.1 billion to become 80% owners of Koch Industries, split evenly. But fraternal litigation continued for 17 more years. [61]\n\nAfter the 1962 publication of Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring, exposing the devastating environmental fallout from irresponsible chemical practices, Congress passed the **Clean Air Act**, the **Clean Water Act**, the **Toxic Substances Control Act**, and other laws creating the modern regulatory state. [90] In 1970, legislation created the **Environmental Protection Agency** and the **Occupational Safety and Health Administration**. In developing regulations, the EPA was directed to weigh only one concern - public health. Costs to industry were deemed irrelevant. [90]\n\nCharles transformed his private foundation into the **Cato Institute** [date? 106], giving $10-20 million of tax-deductible donations over its first 3 years to the nation’s first libertarian think tank. [106] Ed Crane, Cato’s president, “would always call Wichita and run everything by Charles. It was quite clear that Koch was in charge.” [107]\n\n&gt; Ed Crane quotes his conversation with Charles Koch to start the Cato Institute, “I said my bank account was empty. He said, ‘How much do you need?’ [Crane:] ’A libertarian think tank along the model of Brookings or AEI might be nice’. [Koch:] ’I’ll give it to you’.” [107]\n\n## Owner (sole?) of **Koch Industries**\n \nSecond largest private company in America \nOwning: [5]\nfour thousand miles of pipelines [5]\noil refineries in Alaska, Texas and Minnesota [5]\nthe Georgia-Pacific lumber and paper company [5]\ncoal [5] (the C. Reiss Coal Company [264]\nchemicals [5]\nFertilizer, petroleum coke manufacturing, timber, leases on over a million acres of untapped Canadian oil sands [264]\nhuge traders in commodities futures [5]\n\n### His father Fred Koch became rich by building oil refineries for the Stalin and Hitler regimes in the 1930s [34-37]\n\nBy 1975, the government had charged the company with violating federal oil price controls and overcharging $10 million for propane gas. [106]\n\nIn 1989, the U.S. Senate released a scathing report accusing Koch of “a widespread and sophisticated scheme to steal crude oil from Indians and others through fraudulent mis-measuring”. [159] Senate investigators said “It wasn’t like politics; it was like investigating organized crime”. [160] One witness noted, “They’ve got more money than many small countries do” [161] The report was the result of other oil companies secretly turning Koch in for cheating, since they did not have substantial measurement problems. [159]\n\nIn 1995, the Justice Department sued Koch for lying about leaking millions of gallons of oil from its pipelines and storage facilities in 6 different states. [154] Federal investigators documented over 300 oil spills during the previous 5 years, including one 100,000 gallon crude oil spill that left a 12 mile long slick in the bay off of Corpus Christi, not far from the Koch refinery. [154] Angela O’Connell, the lead federal prosecutor, suspected her trash was being searched and her phone bugged, but in the end, she prevailed when Koch Industries agreed to pay a $30 million fine, the biggest in history to that point, for violations of the Clean Water Act. [154-155]\n\nIn 1999, the jury awarded plaintiff Danny Smalley almost three times his requested $100 million in damages for the death of his daughter from the explosion of butane gas from one of Koch’s corroded pipelines, $296 million - the largest wrongful death award on record. [156-159]\nAfter the 1989 Senate report, Bill Koch, the youngest Koch brother, was told by one news outlet that his two older brothers could go to jail but replied “Then lock ‘em up! I did not want my family, my legacy, my father’s legacy, to be based on organized crime.” [161] He had sued his brothers for allegedly deliberately undervaluing the company and cheating him of his fair share of the family fortune. [162] So after the following criminal prosecution failed, Bill filed a whistle-blower lawsuit under the False Claims Act against Koch Industries [163-164] and found a former employee who worked his way up from a “gauger” measuring crude oil when buying from suppliers to senior management, Phil Dubose, to take the stand about “the Koch Method” who testified:\n\n&gt; “They were just mis-measuring crude oil from the Indian reservations as they did all over the U.S. If you bought crude, you’d shorten the gauge. They’d show you how. They had meters in the field. They’d recalibrate them, so if it showed a barrel, they’d say it was just three-quarters of a barrel when they were buying it. You did it in different ways. You cheated. If we sold a barge with fifteen hundred barrels, you’d say it was two thousand. It all involved weights and measurements, and they had their thumb on the scale. That was the Koch Method.” [166]\n\n&gt; “The Kochs never did play by the rules. They had their own playing field. They just didn’t abide by anything. Not the EPA or anything else. They constantly polluted. If they got fined, it didn’t matter because they made so much money doing it. We never reported things like busted pipeline out in the field. Otherwise, we’d get fined. When we spilled oil, we never reported the real amount. We were told to do that, to keep our costs down. The Kochs expected us to lie and try to cover it up.” [167] A book, Sons of Wichita by Daniel Schulman, details their serial lawbreaking. [154]\n\n&gt; “You don’t have to be a genius like Bill Gates to make money the way they did. They just did it by breaking the rules all over the country.” [167]\n\nWhen the lawsuit settled for $25 million (less than the potential $200 million) with most going to the federal government and a quarter going to Bill plus his legal fees, Dubose said, “It was the first time they were defeated. We won because they didn’t have a weapon as big as the one we used. The truth.” [168]\n\nBy mid-2001 the warring brothers reached a ceasefire known as the “global settlement”, where Charles, David, and Bill agreed to no further litigation and a binding non-disparagement clause that imposed hefty escalating financial penalties for violations. [168]\n\n### EPA ranked Koch Industries as one of only three companies in America that was simultaneously a top ten polluter of air, water and climate [date? xiv]\n\nKoch Industries alone routinely released some 24 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere a year. [264]\n\n### In 2010, despite some improvement, Koch Industries was still rated one of the top ten air polluters in the United States, by Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. [168]\n\n### In 2012, the EPA’s database revealed Koch Industries was the #1 producer of toxic waste - 950 million pounds. [168-169], [338] It also released 56.8 million pounds of hazardous materials into the air, water, and soil, making it the country’s 5th largest polluter. [338]\n\nAfter the lawsuits and prosecutions, the Kochs sold off many of their most troublesome pipelines, paring their holdings down to 4000 miles, and moved heavily into the finance sector, trading commodities and derivatives, where regulations and oversight were weaker. [169] They diversified rapidly, acquiring DuPont’s synthetic textile division, Invest, for $4.1 billion in 2004, making them the world’s producers of Lycra and other well-known brands such as StainMaster carpet. [169] In 2005, they bought out Georgia-Pacific, the huge wood-products company, for $21 billion, making them one of the world’s biggest manufacturers of plywood, laminates, and ubiquitous paper products like Dixie cups, Brawny paper towels, and Quilted Northern toilet paper, as well as a major producer of formaldehyde. [169]\n\n# **The Koch network, Kochtopus, most donors in the top .1% or higher of the nation’s wealthiest citizens** [8]\n\n### Coal, oil, and gas magnates formed the nucleus of the Koch donor network. [246]\n\n### Koch donors are mostly private owners of their businesses with no requirements for public disclosures to shareholders [22]\n\n### The Koch summits for conservative donors twice a year started in 2003 [10], mainly to oppose any government action on climate change that would hurt their profits [11]; most agreed on opposing government regulation and taxation. [16]\nThe summits began with 15 people in 2003 to include 18 billionaires in 2015 who alone were worth more than $214 billion [13] and about 400 of the richest people in the country [10-16?]\n\n### 2016, bigger payroll than the Republican National Committee, with the aim of targeting 5 million voters in 8 states with key Senate races, to keep both houses of Congress under conservative Republican control and then to continue the sweep of state and local legislatures that began in 2010 [xvii] in Texas alone, 74 different races including county court commissioner [xviii]\n1,600 paid staffers in 35 states to cover 80% of the population [xvii]\n\n# **Richard Mellon Scaife**, heir to the Mellon banking and Gulf Oil fortunes [6] and Alcoa aluminum [73]\n\nScaife’s memoir estimates that he helped bankroll at least 133 of the conservative movement’s 300 most important institutions. [93]\n\nIn 1975, the Scaife Family Charitable Trust gave $195,000 to the new conservative think tank in Washington started in 1973 whose first donor was Joseph Coors, a scion of the archconservative Colorado-based Coors brewery family, the **Heritage Foundation**. From 1975-1985, Scaife became its largest backer, donating $10 million more [93] and by 1988, their donations totaled $23 million. [93]\n\nPreviously, Scaife had been the largest donor to the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), the older, rival conservative think tank in Washington but preferred a research center that would actively lobby members of Congress before decisions were made instead of worrying about its nonprofit status [94]\n\nUnlike traditional research institutes e.g. the Brookings Institution, founded in 1916, whose mission was to be “free from any political or pecuniary interest” and mandated that scholars of many viewpoints populate its board [96], the Heritage Foundation prided itself on creating, selling, and injecting deeply conservative ideas into the American mainstream. [94]\n\nOliver Smedley, cofounder of the grandfather of libertarian think tanks in London, the Institute of Economic Affairs as well as the Manhattan Institute in New York, said it was “imperative that we should give no indication in our literature that we are working to educate the public along certain lines which might be interpreted as having a political bias. In other words, if we said openly that we were re-teaching the economics of the free market, it might enable our enemies to question the charitableness of our motives”. [97]\n\nInstead in the 1970s, they would accuse existing establishment organizations committed to neutrality and public service like Brookings and the New York Times of equal “bias” in favor of the public interest and being liberal. [99]\n\n&gt; “They introduced doubt into areas of settled academic and scientific scholarship, undermined genuinely unbiased experts [100] and gave politicians a menu of conflicting statistics and arguments from which to choose” [100] … The hazard … was that partisan shills would create “balance” based on fraudulent research and deceive the public about pressing issues in which their sponsors had financial interests.” [100] \n\nBy the 1980s, Heritage Foundation’s other sponsors included Fortune 500 companies such as Amoco, Amway, Boeing, Chase Manhattan Bank, Chevron, Dow Chemical, Exxon, General Electric, General Motors, Mesa Petroleum, Mobil Oil, Pfizer, Philip Morris, Proctor &amp; Gamble, R. J. Reynolds, Searle, Sears, Roebuck, SmithKline Beckman, Union Carbide, and Union Pacific. [108]\n\n### By the early 1980s, the reversal of public opinion was so significant that Americans’ distrust of government for the first time surpassed their distrust of business. [108]\n\nBy 1985, the Heritage Foundation’s budget equaled that of Brookings and AEI combined. [111] Scaife, whose total by then was $10 million, was contributing $1 million per year. [111]\nPaul Weyrich, cofounder of the Heritage Foundation, [94] created the Republican Study Committee, a caucus where the Heritage Foundation was the only outsider to caucus with Republican members of Congress. [108]\n\nWeyrich also created the **American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC)**, a group aimed at waging conservative fights in every state legislature in the country. [109]\n\nFrom 1973-1983, the Scaife and Mellon family trusts donated $500,000 to ALEC, constituting most of its budget. [109]\n\n### The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), created by Paul Weyrich, cofounder of the Heritage Foundation in the 1970’s [109], became a conservative corporate “bill mill” where thousands of businesses and trade groups paid expensive dues to attend closed-door conferences with local officials where they drafted model legislation that state legislators subsequently introduced as their own. [425-426] On average, ALEC produced about 1000 new bills a year, some 200 of which became state law. [426] ALEC was almost indistinguishable from a corporate lobbying operation, but defined itself as a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) “educational” organization. [426] For years, among ALEC’s most active members was the for-profit prison industry. [426] In 1995, ALEC began promoting mandatory-minimum sentences for drug offenses. [426] Two years later, Charles Koch bailed ALEC out financially with a $430,000 loan. [426]\n\nWeyrich cofounded “The Moral Majority” with Jerry Falwell, which brought social and religious conservatives into the pro-corporate fold. [110]\n\nReagan delivered 61% of Heritage’s 1,270 policy proposals from its policy playbook, Mandate for Leadership. [110]\n\nBetween 1981-1986, the top income tax was cut from 70% to 28%. Meanwhile, taxes on the bottom 4/5 rose. Economic inequality, which had flatlined, began to climb. [111]\n\n# **John M. Olin**, chemical and munitions company titan [6] and Cornell graduate and former trustee [112]\n\nThe Olin Corporation began in East Alton, Illinois in 1892 as a manufacturer of blasting powder for coal miners and then expanded into making small arms and ammunition, quintupling its revenues due to WWI and WWII due to its huge government contracts e.g. $40 million in profits from WWII alone. [115] After a 1954 merger with the Mathieson Chemical Corporation, it made everything from pharmaceuticals in its Squibb division to Winchester rifles and the hydrazine rocket fuel powering Neil Armstrong’s 1969 lunar landing. [116] \n\nBut by 1973, the Olin Corporation was embroiled in serious, expensive litigation over its environmental practices [115] such as its production of DDT, of which it supplied 20% of the US total [116]. \n\nIn 1970, the New York Times reported that the U.S. Interior Department charged the Olin Corporation with dumping 26.6 pounds of mercury a day into the Niagara River in upstate New York. [117] Three former corporate officers were convicted of falsifying records in the case and the judge imposed the maximum available fine of $70,000. [117] \nHowever, Olin Corporation’s pollution was so extensive and intractable that it faced the prospect of tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars in cleanup costs, with no end in sight. [118]\n\nIn Saltville, one of its company towns in Virginia, the company estimated it dumped about 100 pounds of mercury a day into public waterways from 1951-1970. [118] The cost of cleaning up Saltville was projected to be upwards of $35 million. [121] Facing increasing competition, battles with the United Mine Workers and new 1970 Virginia standards that it couldn’t meet, the Olin Corporation shut down the plant in 1972 and sold most of its real estate [119-120]. Soon after, the EPA designated Saltville one of the country’s first “Superfund” sites.\n\n### The Olin Foundation underwrote 83% of the costs of all “Law and Economics” programs in American law schools, including Harvard, Yale, Chicago, Columbia, Cornell, Georgetown and the University of Virginia - a new approach to jurisprudence known as which stressed the need to analyze laws, including regulations, not just for fairness but also for their economic impact. [130-131] Other donations included an $18 million donation for the John M. Olin Center for Law, Economics, and Business at Harvard Law School [132] and $5.5 million in start up funds, along with other donors such as foundations tied to Scaife and the Kochs, for the Federalist Society in 1982, a powerful professional network of 42,000 right-leaning lawyers, across 150 law school campuses. [134]\n\n# **Harry and Lynde Bradley**, midwesterners enriched by defense contracts [6]\n\nThe Allen-Bradley company was a Milwaukee electronic manufacturer, which relied on government defense contracts for 70% of its business, with its business volume tripling during WWII. [141] It was bought by Rockwell International, America’s largest defense contractor, for $1.6 billion in cash.[140]\n\nThis 1985 merger turned the assets of the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation from $14 million to over $290 million overnight, making it one of the 20 largest foundations in the country. [137]\n\n2/3rd of its grants financed conservative intellectual activity from 600 graduate and post-graduate fellowships, right wing think tanks, conservative journals, and its own publishing house, Encounter Books. [138]\n\nThanks to smart investments, by 2012, the Bradley Foundation’s assets reached over $630 million, enabling more than $32 million in grants that year alone [144] such as $250,000 Bradley Prizes for stars of the movement such as Fox News president, Roger Ailes. [144-145] \nThe Bradley Foundation added Diane Hendricks and Art Pope to its board. [383]\n\nCoors brewing company of Colorado [6], the first donor to the Heritage Foundation in 1973 [94]\n\nDeVos family of Michigan, Amway founders [6]\n\nSteven A.

[247]\n\nJohn Menard Jr., richest man in Wisconsin ($6 billion in 2010 [380]), Koch summit donor and $1.5 million donor to the Wisconsin Club for Growth, an outside dark-money group boosting Walker, whose chain of home improvement stores received $1.8 million in special tax credits when Walker became chair of a state economic development corporation as well as lessened enforcement actions against pollution [379-380]\n\nScott Walker, first-term governor of Wisconsin, who had Koch Industries PAC as his 2nd largest campaign contributor [377] also the beneficiary of the Bradley brothers, Lynde and Harry, of Milwaukee.

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI wanted to share a detailed explanation of what happened after Citizens United to show the level of political strategy, rule testing and game playing that needs to be understood in order to combat these efforts. \n\nThis is my third post summarizing details from Dark Money by Jane Mayer. It’s a 10 year old book but I’m finding that there are still a lot of people that haven’t appreciated her detailed research in laying the whole situation out. My previous post is linked above, which links the post before that. Thanks for reading!\n\n\n### On January 21, 2010, the Court announced its 5-4 decision in the **Citizens United** case, overturning a century of restrictions banning corporations and unions from unlimited spending on political candidates, as long as the money was to outside groups that were technically independent. To reach the verdicts, the Court accepted the argument that corporations had the same right to free speech as citizens, preceded by **SpeechNow** which overturned the same limits for individuals as well. [280] \n\nBradley Smith, leader of the SpeechNow suit, also founded the Center for Competitive Politics, conservative group. [292] Smith was a radically anti regulatory lawyer who pushed for zero public disclosure of political spending. [292] IRS records showed that in 2009 his center was supported by several conservative foundations including the Bradley Foundation [292] The Institute of Justice was also involved. [292-293]\n\nThe SpeechNow litigation was heavily underwritten by Fred Young, a libertarian retiree in Wisconsin who made tens of millions of dollars by selling his father’s firm, Young Radiator Company, after outsourcing the jobs of unionized workers to non-union states. Young served on the boards of the Koch-backed Reason Foundation and Cato Institute and was a regular attendee at the Kochs’ donor summits. [293]\n\nGeorge Soros [6], New York hedge fund magnate, who funneled more than $27 million into outside spending groups known as 527 groups prior to Citizens United, and threatened to spend his $7 billion fortune on defeating President Bush for his invasion of Iraq, withdrew from spectacular campaign funds after the Federal Election Commission fined both Democrats and Republicans for violations but remained an active donor, spending hundreds of millions on a network of human rights and civil liberties groups [290]\n\nAfter Citizens United, Fred Young contributed 80% of the money spent in 2010 by SpeechNow.org's super PAC, including TV ads targeting Wisconsin Democratic senator Russ Feingold, the Senate’s premier supporter of strict campaign spending laws, who urged outside groups not to spend on his behalf and who was defeated [293]\n\nThe budget for Kochs’ flagship group, Americans for Prosperity (AFP) and its foundation went from $2 million in 2004 and $15.2 million in 2008 to $40 million in 2010. [309]\n\n# The Koch donor summits went from $13 million in June 2009 to almost $900 million at a single fundraising session in the years that followed. [293]\n\n## In 2006, only 2% of “outside” political spending came from “social welfare” groups that hid their donors. [305] In 2010, this rose to 40%, masking hundreds of millions of dollars. [305] \n\nFor the 2014 elections, the Koch network poured over $100 million into competitive races and almost twice that into other kinds of activism. [455] The largest disclosed donor in 2014 was Tom Steyer, the California hedge fund magnate turned environmental activist, with $74 million trying to elect candidates who pledged to fight global warming. [455] But the 100 biggest known donors in 2014 spent nearly as much money as the 4.75 million who contributed $200 or less, giving $323 million of disclosed money, not including the millions in unlimited, undisclosed money. [455] \n\n# During the five years before a 2015 interview, the Koch network had contributed over $760 million to mysterious and ostensibly apolitical nonprofits such as the Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, the Center to Protect Patient Rights, and the TC4 Trust. [456] \n\n**While amassing one of the most lucrative fortunes in the world, the Kochs had also created an ideological assembly line justifying it. Now they had added a powerful political machine to protect it. They had hired top-level operatives, financed their own voter data bank, commissioned state-of-the-art polling, and created a fund-raising operation that enlisted hundreds of other wealthy Americans to help pay for it. They had also forged a coalition of some 17 allied conservative groups with niche constituencies who would mask their centralized source of funding and carry their message. To mobilize Latino voters, they formed a group called the Libre Initiative. To reach conservative women, they funded the Concerned Women for America. For millennials, they formed Generation Opportunity. To cover up fingerprints on television attack ads, they hid behind the American Future Fund and other front groups. Their network’s money also flowed to gun groups, retirees, veterans, antilabor groups, antitax groups, evangelical Christian groups, and even $4.5 million for something called the Center for Shared Services, which coordinated tasks such as office space rentals and paperwork for the others. Americans for Prosperity (AFP), meanwhile, organized chapters all across the country. The Kochs had established what was in effect their own private political party. ** ***Secrecy permeated every level of the operation. One former Koch executive, Ben Pratt, who became the chief operating officer of the voter data bank, Themis, used a quotation from Salvador Dali on his personal blog that could have served as the enterprise’s motto: “The secret of my influence is that it has always remained a secret.” [384-385]***\n\nA former Democrat, Ed Gillespie, was a top national political tactician who became the chairman of the Republican National Committee in 2003 at the age of 41 and who, as founder of Quinn Gillespie &amp; Associates, a bipartisan lobbying firm, made as much as $19 million. [297] Within weeks of Citizens United, Gillespie met Karl Rove, his fellow Bush White House alumnus, to plan a new shadow political machine. [297] \n\n### With Obama dominating Washington, Gillespie looked to the states. [298] He knew that 2011 was a year in which many state legislatures would redraw the boundaries of their congressional districts based on a new census, a process that only took place once a decade. [298] So he aimed at a Republican takeover of governorships and legislatures across the country. [298] Then Republicans could redraw their states’ congressional districts in order to favor their candidates. [298] While the mechanics of state legislative races were abstruse and deadly dull to most people, to Gillespie, they were the key to a Republican comeback. \n\n[298] Gillespie called the plan **“REDMAP” an acronym for the Redistricting Majority Project**. [298] To implement it, he took over the **Republican State Leadership Committee (RSLC)**, a nonprofit group that had previously functioned as a catchall bank account for corporations interested in influencing state laws. [298] All he needed was the money to put REDMAP into action and he got it by the end of 2010 - million dollar donations from tobacco companies Altria and Reynolds and huge donations from Walmart, the pharmaceutical industry, and donors like those at the Koch summit, adding up to $30 million, 3x its Democratic counterpart. [299]\n\nA second man for the new political operation was James Arthur “Art” Pope, a charter member of the Koch network, regular attendee of the Kochs’ secret planning summits, board member of both CSE and its successor AFP, [299] multimillionaire chairman and CEO of Variety Wholesalers, a family-owned discount-store conglomerate with hundreds of outlets up and down the mid-Atlantic and the South, with a seemingly inexhaustible command of political minutiae [299], who served up his home state of North Carolina, historically a pivotal swing state as a test case for REDMAP. [300] \n\nObama had carried it narrowly in 2008 and remained popular in 2010. [300] Democrats dominated the state legislature; Republicans hadn’t controlled both houses of the North Carolina General Assembly for more than 100 years. [300] “Not since General Sherman”, the joke went. [300] Bob Geary, a political reporter for the Indy Week, an alternative newspaper in Durham, described him in his run for lieutenant governor in 1992 as “a terrible candidate … very introverted and pedantic”, but he was a master of arcane election law. [300]\n\nIn the previous decade, Pope, his family and the family foundation had spent more than $40 million on pushing politics to the right. [299] Pope had given money to at least 27 of the groups supported by the Kochs, including organizations opposing environmental regulations, tax increases, unions, and campaign spending limits, such as the James Madison Center for Free Speech. [300]\n\nA third man for the new political operation was Jim Ellis, former “right-hand man” and executive director of his PAC, to Tom DeLay, the powerful House Republican leader from Texas who was infamous for his “K Street operation” which serviced corporate lobbyists while shaking them down for campaign contributions, who had a history of creating fake movements in support of unpopular corporations and causes [301]. \n\nMeanwhile, Randy Kendrick, wife of Koch donor Earl “Ken” Kendrick, a West Virginian millionaire who founded Datatel, a computer software provider for colleges and universities, incorporated the **Center to Protect Patient Rights (CPPR)** on April 16, 2009 together with Sean Noble, her de facto political consultant, to oppose government healthcare and the **Affordable Care Act (ACA)** in particular [230-231].\n\nThe House passed the Affordable Care Act (ACA), despite nasty Tea Party protests e.g. Tim Phillips, AFP’s president, organized a “Kill the Bill” protest on Capitol Hill accusing the Democrats of “trying to cram this 2,000 page bill down the throats of the American people” and a second Capitol Hill protest a few days later where protesters spat on a passing Democratic congressman, called Barney Frank, a gay representative from Massachusetts, a “faggot”, and shouted racist epithets at three black congressmen, John Lewis, Emanuel Cleaver, and Jim Cleaver). [302-303] In response to the ACA’s win in the House, Noble and other Koch operatives focused on taking over the House. [302-303] \n\nFunding for Noble’s CPPR quadrupled by the end of 2010 to $61.8 million. As with all such 501(c)(4) dark money [230] “social welfare” groups, under the tax code, the sources of its funding didn’t have to be publicly disclosed. [304] Another Koch-tied group, **TC4 Trust**, raised $42.7 million that year and routed 1/3 of that to CPPR through a method disguised on disclosure forms, bringing Sean Noble’s kitty up to almost $75 million. [304] \n\nTC4 defined itself as a free-market advocacy group whose “grant funds shall not be used for political activity” [353] but it soon was paying for polling and a public advocacy program aimed at shaping and selling the Republican budget. [353] \n\n&gt; Ed Goeas, the president of the Tarrance Group, a Republican polling company that worked on the budget project, said, “It wasn’t about developing policy, it was about selling it.” [353] The solution was to avoid using the word “cut” when talking about Medicare or Social Security. “There were discussion that you could deal with it as ‘getting your money’s worth out of the government’. You could talk about it as ‘more effective’ - but not as cutting it. It had to be about efficiencies’. That was a large part of it.” [353]\n\nPublic Notice, one of the Koch Brothers’ groups according to Goeas, paid for the research and a public advocacy campaign describing the deficit as a looming catastrophe. [353]\n\n### Sean Noble and CPPR focused on the House to oppose the ACA while Karl Rove used **American Crossroads and its 501(c)(4), Crossroads GPS**, to work on the Senate. [306] Ed Gillespie continued to focus on governorships and state legislatures, in accordance with his REDMAP strategy. [306] \n\n### The operatives steered their funds to obscure, smaller groups to meet the legal requirement that no single public welfare group could spend more than half of its funds on elections. [306] Soon, to the unschooled eye, a rash of spontaneous attacks on Democrats appeared to be breaking out all across the country. [306] In reality, the effort was so centrally coordinated, as one participant put it, “there wasn’t one race in which there were multiple groups airing ads at the same time”. [306]\n\n&gt; Noble explained his methodology later to Eliana Johnson, Washington editor for the conservative publication National Review, with an Excel spreadsheet showing a list of Democratic congressmen “in order of their likelihood of defeat” which would grow to 105 by August. Then, he assigned each congressional district with a “win potential” of 1-5 and each candidate with a score of 1-40 “based on the voting record of each member and the composition of the district, among other things”, then sorting the 105 targeted candidates into “three tiers, based on the likelihood of a GOP victory” and disbursing the Koch network’s money accordingly. [307]\n\nFor example, as explained to National Review, Noble chose the **60 Plus Association**, a right-wing version of the senior citizens’ lobby AARP to air attack ads on Democrats in “Arizona’s 1st Congressional District, Florida’s 2nd and 24th, Indiana’s 2nd, Minnesota’s 8th, New York’s 20th, Ohio’s 16th, Pennsylvania’s 3rd, and Wisconsin’s 3rd and 8th Congressional Districts”. [307]\n\nHe used **Americans for Job Security** to air ads in “New York’s 24th, North Carolina’s 2nd and 8th, Ohio’s 18th, and Virginia’s 9th Congressional District” [307] Despite being founded in 1997 by a million-dollar donation from the insurance industry, its physical office in Alexandria, VA was almost empty with only one employee, a 25 year old Republican campaign aide acquainted with Noble. [308] It was accused of being “a sham front group” by Public Citizen, a liberal group favoring tighter campaign finance regulations, and when charged with violations of fair election rules by Alaskan state officials, it settled for $20,000 with no admission of guilt [308] It was given $4.8 million in 2010 by Noble’s CPPR. [308]\n\nHe used Iowa-based **American Future Fund**, a 501(c)(4) “social welfare” group, to air attack ads in Alabama’s 2nd, Colorado’s 7th, New Mexico’s 1st, and Washington’s 2nd Congressional Districts. [307] Though AFF was founded in 2008 by an Iowa Republican operative, Bruce Rastetter, one of the country’s largest ethanol producers, its tax records showed that 87% of its funds in 2009 and about 50% in 2010 came from Noble’s CPPR. [308]\n\nRick Boucher, a conservative Democratic congressman representing the rural Virginia district encompassing Saltville, the Olin Corporation’s factory town that turned into a toxic waste dump, lost his seat to his Republican opponent, Morgan Griffith, after AFP and other conservative outside groups spent $2 million on attack ads against him. [309-310] He was a Virginia lawyer and strong ally of business interests who had been crucial to the passage of the cap-and-trade bill in the House, drafting much of the measure and then winning support for it from huge energy firms like Duke Energy and had represented the district for 28 years in the House and 8 more before that in the state senate. [309] He had given away so many goodies to the coal industry while negotiating the bill that many environmentalists were disgusted but the fact that he supported the bill angered conservative extremists such as the Virginia coal barons funding the Koch network. [309] He was exactly the kind of centrist that big, polarized political money was rendering extinct. [309]\n\n&gt; Boucher said, “This is Appalachia! It’s a cheap media market. That would have been like $10 million most other places. [His opponent] actually didn’t raise and spend much, but he didn’t have to, because the Koch groups carried his water”. [310]\n\n### When House Democrats passed a bill (2010?), backed by President Obama, to eliminate the carried interest loophole (which allowed much of the income of hedge fund and private equity managers to be categorized as “interest” at less than half the income rate then applied to long-term gains), Stephen Schwarzman (estimated worth of $6.5 billion [year? 312]) and others were enraged. [311-313] Former Obama bundler Ken Griffin, founder and CEO of the Chicago-based hedge fund Citadel, turned Republican in what came known as the “Hedge Fund Switch”. These billionaires attended the Koch’s second summit of the year in Aspen (where of the 200 or so participants, with least 11 were on Forbes’ list of the 400 wealthiest Americans, had an estimated wealth of $129.1 billion) and pumped at least $10 million into groups boosting Republicans in the midterms, often without any public trace. [314]\n\n### The Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank, estimated that this loophole cost the government over $6 billion a year - the cost of providing healthcare to 3 million children. [313] Of that total, $2 billion a year from the tax break went to just 25 individuals. [313]\n\nEven before the Republicans formally took control of the House, the president felt forced into making concessions on tax issues vital to the donor class. [354] \n\nIn December 2010, he reached a deal that temporarily extended unemployment benefits for millions out of work and reducing payroll taxes and other help for the middle class in exchange for extending Bush-era income tax cuts benefitting the wealthy that had been set to expire. [354] \n\nThose cuts lowered the top income tax rate from 39.6% to 35%, and unearned income taxes mostly earned by the rich, for example, capital gains taxes from 20% to 15% and dividend taxes from 39.6% to 15%. As a result, many rich Americans were taxed at a lower rate than middle and working class earners. [354] Republican negotiators insisted on cuts on estate taxes costing the Treasury $23 billion and saving 6600 of the wealthiest taxpayers $1.5 million each. [357] \n\nThe Kochs, DeVoses and 15 other of the richest families in the country including the Waltons of Walmart and the Mars candy clan, according to one 2006 report, had spent almost half a billion on lobbying for the “death tax” cuts since 1998, because the 17 families stood to save $71 billion. [357] Only .27% of all estates were wealthy enough to be affected by estate taxes. [357]\n\nIn the beginning, the 16th Amendment which legalized the income tax was only levied on the very rich. [355] Rates were especially high in wartime when taxes were seen as the patriotic duty of the privileged, such as 77% for top earners in WWI, and 94% in WWII (which the Scaife family avoided with its trusts and foundations). [355]\n\nA 2008 study of the wealthiest 400 taxpayers showed they earned an average of $202 million and paid an effective tax rate of less than 20%. [354] 60% of their declared income derived from capital gains. [354]\n\nThe Kochs’ AFP pledged to spend $45 million for the 2010 midterms, Karl Rove’s American Crossroads $52 million, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce $75 million. [316-317] \n\nFor the 2012 presidential campaign, the Kochs came up with a new nonprofit corporation, a 501(c)(6) business league, the **Association for American Innovation (AAI)** to collect donations, categorized as “membership dues” partially tax deductible as business expenses. [375] Donors could be both anonymous and outside the charitable scrutiny of the state attorneys general, further safeguarding secrecy. [375] During 2011 alone, tax records show that AAI had over $250 million, over a quarter of a billion. [375] \n\nAAI soon changed its name to **Freedom Partners**, funding the same political front groups that the Kochs used in the 2010 midterms, such as $115 million to Sean Noble’s Center to Protect Patient Rights (CPPR) and $32.3 million to David Koch’s Americans for Prosperity (AFP) from November 2011 to October 2012. [375] \n\n### Later, an initial 2015 plan to spend $889 million to purchase the presidency [xvi] was downgraded to $750 million, several hundred million to races beneath the presidential level [xvi]\n\nFoster Friess, the Wyoming mutual fund magnate, committed $3 million to found The Daily Caller in 2010, which Charles Koch’s foundation would later back as well, after a single luncheon conversation with Tucker Carlson, its prospective editor in chief, to be a conservative version of The Huffington Post. [320] In fact, it functioned more as an outlet for opposition research paid for by donors. (After The New Yorker published Jane Meyer’s investigative article on the Kochs, “Covert Operations”, The Daily Caller was the chosen receptacle for the retaliatory opposition research on her, but when leads proved false, they decided not to run it. [320]\n\n&gt; Bob Phillips, head of the North Carolina chapter of Common Cause, an organization for stricter controls on political money, concluded that the Citizens United decision was an even bigger “game changer” at the local level than at the national. [323] “Citizens United opened up the door. Now a candidate can literally be outspent by independent groups. We saw it in North Carolina, and a lot of the money was traced back to Art Pope”. [323] Chris Heagarty, a Democratic lawyer who ran for a legislative seat that fall in Raleigh, said, “If you put all of the Pope groups together, they and the North Carolina GOP spent more to defeat me than the guy who actually won. For an individual to have so much power is frightening. The government of North Carolina is for sale.” [323-324]\n\nPope countered that his political spending was not bribery, which was “illegal, corrupt, and something I’ve fought hard against in North Carolina” but “education” of citizens. [324] Of the 22 local legislative races targeted by Pope, his family and their organizations in North Carolina in 2010, the Republicans won 18 in the historically Democratic state. [324-325] As he and Gillespie hoped, this placed both chambers of the general assembly firmly under Republican majorities for the first time since 1870. [325] According to the Institute for Southern Studies, 3/4 of the spending by independent groups in North Carolina’s 2010 state races came from accounts linked to Pope. [325] The total amount that Pope and his family and groups backed by him spent - $2.2 million - was not much by national standards but enough to exert crucial influence within one state, which would repeat across the nation. [325] \n\n&gt; The chairman of REDMAP, former Republican congressman, Tom Reynolds, later told Politico, “The Obama team has done some amazing things, those guys are really something, but the Democrats plain got skunked on the state houses”. [326]\n\nIt’s likely given historical trends and an unemployment rate topping 9.5% that a Republican wave in 2010 was inevitable, but Noble had made so much progress that, by the final weeks in the campaign, he was aiming beyond his 3rd tier candidates at congressmen no one had ever believed were vulnerable. [327]\n\n### On November 2, 2010, the Democrats suffered massive defeats, losing control of the House of Representatives. [327] Republicans gained 63 seats in the House - the largest such turnover since 1948 - and half a dozen seats in the Senate [327], making North Carolina, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin newly Republican states. [328] At the state level, the Democratic losses were even more staggering, with Republicans gaining 675 seats. [327-328]\n\n### The Ohio Republican, John Boehner, the new Speaker of the House, now had a caucus bursting with Tea Party enthusiasts who had ridden to power by attacking government in general and Obama in particular, several winning primaries against moderates. [327] Compromise wasn’t in their interest [327] \n\n&gt; Political scientist Lee Drutman, in a study for the nonpartisan Sunlight Foundation, found that increasingly concentrated wealth in America resulted in more polarization and extremism, especially on the right, the “radical rich”. [335] \n\n&gt; Very rich benefactors in the Republican Party were far more opposed to taxes and regulations than the rest of the country. [335] He said, “The more Republicans depend upon the 1% of the 1% of donors, the more conservative they tend to be”. [335]\n\n### Harvard’s Theda Skocpol found that the House “took the biggest leap to the far right” since political scientists began recording quantitative measurements of legislators’ positions, as exemplified by the House Energy and Commerce Committee. [335] \n\n### In the previous Congress, the Committee had been chaired by Henry Waxman, the liberal Democrat from California who had quarterbacked the House’s successful passage of the cap-and-trade bill that was defeated in the Senate. [336] Now, the committee was packed with Republicans owing huge campaign debts to the Kochs. [336] Koch Industries had donated to 22 of the committee’s 31 Republican members and 5 of its Democratic members. [336] Koch Industries PAC was the single largest oil and gas industry donor to members of the panel, outspending even ExxonMobil. [336]\n\nCongressman Morgan Griffith, victor over Rick Boucher in the district representing Saltville, Virginia, became a lead player in the House Republicans’ “war on the EPA” [336-337] and within a month after taking office, he and other House Republicans gutted the EPA’s budget by a punishing 27%, which was later modified to 16% with the Senate. [337] By then, the 1980 Superfund law charging polluters like the Olin Corporation for cleanup costs expired and the $3.8 billion accumulated in the fund had run out, leaving taxpayers rather than corporations to clean up the mess. [337]\n\nThe Republicans tried to halt action on global warming, prevent the protection of any new endangered species, permit uranium mining adjacent to the Grand Canyon, deregulate mountaintop mining, prevent coal ash from being designated a form of air pollution, and proposed legislation requiring it to consider the costs of its regulations, without regard to the scientific and health benefits, which the editorial page of the Los Angeles Times said “rips the heart out of the 40-year-old Clean Air Act”. [340]\n\n### Two months into their tenure, the House Energy and Commerce Committee Republicans led a crusade against alternative, renewable energy programs. [340-341] They successfully branded the government’s stimulus support for Solyndra, a California manufacturer of solar panels, and other clean energy firms as an Obama scandal, while some of Solyndra’s biggest backers were members of the conservative Walton family, the founders of Walmart. [341]\n\n## By the end of 2011, only 20 of the 65 Republicans who responded to a survey were willing to say that they believed climate change was causing the planet to warm. [341] \n\nIn 2009, Michigan congressman Fred Upton had said, “Climate change is a serious problem that necessitates serious solutions. I strongly believe that everything must be on the table as we seek to reduce carbon emissions”. [339] But in 2010, Upton, like many Republican moderates, faced a potentially career-killing primary challenge from the right. [339] He reversed his position by co-authoring an op-ed piece in The Wall Street Journal with Tim Phillips, AFP’s president, where they called the EPA’s plans to regulation carbon emissions “an unconstitutional power grab that will kill millions of jobs unless Congress steps in”, and he secured the chairmanship of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. [339-340] Robert Inglis of South Carolina, who accepted the growing scientific consensus on climate change, was defeated for violating “Republican orthodoxy”. [339] \n\n&gt; Tim Phillips, AFP’s president, said “We’ve made great headway. What it means for candidates on the Republican side is, if you … buy into green energy or you play footsie on this issue, you do so at your political peril”. [342]\n\n## By 2011, Speaker Boehner, among the most powerful elected officials in the country, third in line in the order of presidential succession, traveled to New York to personally beseech David Koch for help with a Congressional stalemate regarding the debt ceiling.

        "selftext": "When I first started at my present company, the IT infrastructure was outdated like very outdated. I started working here towards the end of 2020 and all of the network switches were 10/100. The ERP system was a terminal based system, and we were still printing using dot matrix printers.\n\nSince then we have migrated to a cloud based ERP, and I have replaced our switches to gigabit switches. At the time we were using WatchGuard XTM 330 as our main device, and WatchGuard XTM 33 devices at two branch offices. These were pretty much end of life when I started, so we moved over to a new VOIP provider who provided us with Cato boxes at each site. \n\nWithin the past year our VOIP/Cato invoices went from around $1.5k per month to $2.6k for no apparent reason. We'll be terminating our contracts with the vendor, and looks like it will be worth while switching back to WatchGuard devices. I still have our old boxes so I should be able to make use of the trade up deals.\n\nI was wondering if anybody could review the devices I am thinking of upgrading to. \n\nNetwork Devices at HQ: 65 (Computers, VOIP phones, Printers, and Tablets) = T290\n\nNetwork Devices at Branch1: 25 (Computers, VOIP phones, Printers, and Tablets) = T85\n\nNetwork Devices at Branch 2: 5 (1 x Computer, 3 x VOIP phones, and 1 x Tablet) = T45\n\nVPN Users: 1 Full time, 10 on / off users.\n\nWe have Verizon Fios at all 3 locations, 2 with gigabit speeds, and the other around 500mbps. \n\nAt the HQ location I was looking at putting a T290, 1 x T85 @ Branch 1, 1 x T45 @ Branch 2.\n\nHope this is allowed here.",

It really depends on what security services you are using. \n\nAs recommended, check out the Sizing tool. The more security services you enable (ex: Gateway AV to scan all packets for viruses, Webblocker for Web Filtering, DNSWatch for DNS protection, DPISSL to see inside encrypted traffic, etc) the more bandwidth gets taken that is available.",

        "title": "Recap of the AMA of May 30th with Michael MO",
        "selftext": "  \nHello everyone!\n\nI wanted to share an exciting update with you all. Today, we had an AMA (Ask Me Anything) session with Michael Mo, the CEO of KULR Technology. The AMA took place in our subreddit chat, and it was a great opportunity for us to interact directly with Michael and get our questions answered.\n\n**Transcript of KULR Technology AMA (Ask Me Anything) Session**\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:01 PM - Good Afternoon Everyone! Thank you for being here for the KULR Technology AMA. We're getting Michael into the KULR account right now and we'll get started. We received over 40 questions over the past 24 hours. We're going to run through all of the ones we can starting with those previously received. New questions will be recorded and added to the end.\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:05 PM - Hello everyone, thanks for joining today.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:05 PM - Going to tag the user who asked the question too.\n\nu/Crazerz**:** Which business segment do you expect to drive the most growth in the upcoming year? What initiatives are in place to maximize opportunities within this segment?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:06 PM - I see our KULR ONE Design Service driving most of the growth in the next 12 months, including the FTRC testing service and design services. That's a very sticky and fast-growing business for us and driving recurring revenue.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:07 PM - u/Crazerz: Does the company believe its competitive advantage is strengthening? If so, what key factors contribute to this?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:08 PM - Definitely strengthening in our competitive advantages. All from Data, Safety, and Speed. We provide our customers with battery cell data that they can't get anywhere else. And our safety focus heritage is getting more focus from customers, similar to how the chip industry prioritizes energy efficiency.\n\nu/CatosWizard**:** Hello Michael, I wanted to know about commercial partners and how you plan to expand that sector with your amazing products.\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:11 PM - I believe we will see a shift in batteries to safety-focused and thermal performance-focused solutions, and that's where KULR shines.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:11 PM - u/Crazerz: How is the company ensuring timely order deliveries amidst increased volumes to prevent backlog issues affecting revenue recognition?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:12 PM - With respect to revenue recognition, we follow established accounting rules. Meeting customer timing requests is critical. We are always trying to gain additional efficiencies to do more with the resources we have.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:13 PM - u/Crazerz: What are the critical milestones for achieving positive cash flow and profitability? How will the company navigate toward these goals?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:14 PM - Growing the revenue and controlling costs. It's simple and hard. We have been growing our revenue on both design services and product sales in Q1.\n\n**cwaim:** Hello Mr. Mo, hope you are having a great day. I wanted to ask if there are currently other products planned to be added to the KULR marketplace in the future (this may have been asked).\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:15 PM - We reduced our cash use and operating expenses by 23% and 25%. We will continue to look for efficiencies.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:15 PM - u/Crazerz: Are we still on track to achieve cash flow positivity by the end of Q2 2024?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:16 PM - We haven't provided official financial guidance at this time.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:17 PM - u/Crazerz: Many investors are curious which EV companies KULR is collaborating with. Can you elaborate on the secrecy of these names?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:18 PM - We are under NDA, so we can't disclose the names of our big customers. We do our PR to keep our investors informed on the progress and also as a way to market our products to more customers. It's very cost-effective for us.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:18 PM - u/Crazerz: Is the previously stated guidance of $26 to $34 million for 2024, as mentioned in an earlier interview with CFO Shaw Canter, still accurate?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:19 PM - We are not giving 2024 financial guidance at this time.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:19 PM - u/Crazerz: Any plans for future share offerings or sales, especially regarding the recent debt cancellation with Yorkville? How does this impact the company's financial strategy?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:21 PM - We have a policy of not commenting on future financial activities. KULR is in the strongest financial position and balance sheet in over a year to execute our growth plan. And we will do everything we can to build shareholder value.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:23 PM - u/Slimjimpapicholo: Can anyone ask Michael Mo about what he thinks about the stock price being an unfair representation of KULR? I think a lot of investors are blindsided by the company's strength and portfolio due to the current share price.\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:24 PM - I think the macro market environment is still quite challenging for smaller companies like KULR to get investor awareness and appreciation.\n\nu/jake_zzzz**:** KULR has consistently stated that there would be no more offerings/dilution after the Yorkville debt was retired, but that seems difficult with the current cash situation. Can you elaborate on how KULR plans to protect shareholders without offering more shares?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:25 PM - We will continue to execute the business and grow and get to profitability. Then you will get more larger investor base appreciation. It took NVDA 30 years to get to today's AI boom. I won't take us 30 years to get the market to appreciate what we do. We have been at it for 10 years.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:26 PM - Reminder to the chat. We're answering questions from yesterday's post. We'll answer new questions at the end here.\n\nu/KingNebar**:** Any plans to manufacture and sell testing equipment to other companies?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:29 PM - No plan to sell equipment. However, because our testing service is booked for a couple of quarters out, we are expanding the testing equipment line and talking to customers about subscription services models, preferred allocation services, and other recurring revenue services to increase utilization and profitability, and make our customers more successful.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:30 PM - u/Ill-Desk-1979: How do you plan on stopping the stock from a reverse split?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:31 PM - We announced that NYSE has informed us that we have gained compliance on the share price requirement. So we are in no obligation to do a reverse split and will continue to do all we can to build shareholder value.\n\nu/ethereal3xp**:** Hi Michael. Thank you for doing this. Are any of KULR's products currently in the production stage/orders? If this is the case at this time or not, is there capability for this type of scale of production?\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:32 PM - u/Crazerz: What's the company's future patent application strategy? Any specific areas or technologies targeted for patent protection?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:33 PM - Our patent strategy has been consistent to patent the core technology and its applications. For example, our TRS technology, we patented how to build it and how to use it in a system. As we build out different pieces of KULR ONE Platform, we will continue to patent materials, configurations, and applications.\n\nu/BidAcceptable7555**:** With different Battery Technologies being developed, does KULR testing apply only to Lithium Ion? I know Natron is manufacturing Sodium Ion batteries. Would KULR tech still apply to that one?\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:35 PM - u/Crazerz: Regarding the online store, any plans to expand its availability internationally?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:36 PM - We just launched the online store, so we are focused on the US market and serving fire departments, Hazmat groups, etc. It's been a busy time. We will expand to international markets later.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:36 PM - Michael, above you said \"in obligation.\" Can you confirm that was a typo based on the recent PR?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:37 PM - Sorry, yes, a typo. We are in NO obligation to do a reverse split.\n\nu/Dense-Corgi2642**:** Any talk of potential government mandates on safe case-type products on EVs?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:39 PM - Government regulations and mandates take a long time. Time and uncertainty are the enemies of business and making money. So we take matters into our own hands and work with OEMs directly to use SafeCase in their production and recycling applications.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:40 PM - u/New-Razzmatazz-2253: What are some obstacles or hardships you believe the company may encounter in the future if any, regarding licensing and regulations?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:41 PM - Regulations have actually been good to KULR. The requirements for battery safety from DOT, NASA, UPS, etc., are beneficial to our business.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:42 PM - u/Sleepytouch: Can you comment on the DoE grant process? Can KULR apply for funding from the DoE? What about partnering with one of the recipients?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:43 PM - The application for DoE grant is very competitive. It's always good for a company to apply. We believe partnering with companies who have received grants would yield good results as well.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:44 PM - u/Ill-Desk-1979: Can KULR try to get Starlink on its side for internet access?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:45 PM - We do use Starlink for our offices. Does that count?\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:45 PM - u/Texasaggie12345: Do you plan on setting up any type of system for tracking/trading carbon credits?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:46 PM - No plans at this time.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:46 PM - u/texasaggie12345: Do you have any plans for significant asset purchases in the next year?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:47 PM - No plans at this time.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:48 PM - u/Loud_Ad2372: Will KULR ever use their SafeCases for residential batteries similar to the Tesla Powerwall? Will there be battery management software applications added to KULR's products?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:49 PM - SafeCase is versatile and can be used in different applications, including residential energy storage applications.\n\nu/skeff88**:** Can you speak to how exactly the rollout with Amazon is going? And what kind of deal you have going with them?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:50 PM - Amazon is the marketplace. We use their network for order fulfillment and delivery. Their fees are not cheap, but it's very effective for us.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:52 PM - u/QueenandHero: What is the most significant milestone KULR has achieved in recent years, and how does the company plan to build on this success to maintain a competitive edge in the market?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:53 PM - Our TRS technology going to Mars and testing and licensing FTRC with FAA are significant milestones. We plan to extend both products to other applications and build out our KULR ONE Platform.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:54 PM - u/KingNebar: Has KULR considered expanding into adjacent markets, such as electric vehicle charging infrastructure, to further diversify its product offerings?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:56 PM - We would consider all options in the EV value chain. We do what our customers and partners need us to do to help them succeed.\n\nu/Manny2150**:** Any large testing orders in the past year?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:57 PM - Yes, there are a number of multi-quarter testing orders in the past year.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 6:58 PM - u/ll-Desk-1979: Is there any new news from today that you would like to share with us?\n\n**Michael (KULRTechnology):** 6:59 PM - Not today. But, stay tuned.\n\n**Moderator (small-cap-voice):** 7:00 PM - Going to call this one for now. Thank you for taking the time Michael and thanks to everyone who asked a question.

Analysts still have the price target in the multi-dollar range.  \n\nAs others have said or will say - look beyond the daily / weekly price action for a second.  Look at the company.  Do they actually have a product / technology they sell?  Do they have real customers or just speculation?\n\n  \nI am biased because I am an engineer in the DoD space that works with some EVs.  I understand the need for safety and regulation.  The Navy has been burnt before (pun intended) with battery fire on a seal delivery vehicle (small sub) - that killed a multi-billion dollar program.  Now the navy has an entire division and manual surrounding lithium batteries and battery safety in general.  Don't believe me?  here it is:\n\n  \n[https://navysbir.com/n21\\_1/Topic-N211-033-Reference\\_Document\\_S9310-AQ-SAF-010-Rev3.pdf](https://navysbir.com/n21_1/Topic-N211-033-Reference_Document_S9310-AQ-SAF-010-Rev3.pdf)\n\n  \nI don't see many other companies in the lithium battery safety space, and I don't see ANY others with the credibility and customer base as KULR.\n\n  \nThis was my DD for buying into the company.",

It is frustrating and not for short-term investors but to build out a business takes time, particularly now when everyone is bearish on small gap growth (that will change - historically they do very well coming out of a recession). What company are you comparing them to? They aren't projected to have positive earnings for another 2 years and the industries they are in are growing but still in their relative infancy (check again in 2030 to see where the space industry and electrification of everything is at...I suspect much further along). If you believe in the company (I do - their tech is market leading and have patents to protect it) and think that battery safety and efficiency is going to be important in 5+ years then best to just buy when cheap and ignore it rather than following it day by day. These are great times to buy at a really reasonable (cheap?) valuation and let them grow over the next decade or so. Apologies for the wordy response, but remember this is an investment in a company rather than a lottery ticket....though in time it could be both. Obviously not financial advice....just some food for thought.",

        "selftext": "\nNo, not even if you do it in a county that borders Mexico.\n\nJOE LANCASTER | 3.14.2025\n\nOne of President Donald Trump's Day 1 executive orders designated \"certain international cartels\" as \"foreign terrorist organizations,\" a classification that according to the State Department \"play[s] a critical role in our fight against terrorism and [is] an effective means of curtailing support for terrorist activities and pressuring groups to get out of the terrorism business.\"\n\nTo that end, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) announced a new rule cracking down on cash transactions this week, but only in certain geographical regions. No matter the administration's intent to target cartels, the rule will expand government surveillance of its citizens.\n\n\nFinCEN \"issued a Geographic Targeting Order (GTO) to further combat the illicit activities and money laundering of Mexico-based cartels and other criminal actors along the southwest border of the United States,\" according to the announcement. \"The GTO requires all money services businesses (MSBs) located in 30 ZIP codes across California and Texas near the southwest border to file Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs) with FinCEN at a $200 threshold, in connection with cash transactions.\"\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the change \"underscores our deep concern with the significant risk to the U.S. financial system of the cartels, drug traffickers, and other criminal actors along the Southwest border.\"\n\nThe order lists all 30 ZIP codes in counties that each abut the U.S.–Mexico border: San Diego and Imperial Counties in California; and Cameron, El Paso, Hidalgo, Maverick, and Webb Counties in Texas. California's are the state's only two border counties, but the five in Texas encompass only a small portion of the state's total southern border. It's not clear why these seven counties were chosen out of the 44 total border counties, including any in Arizona or New Mexico.\n\n\nFederal law requires banks, as well as businesses that provide services like check cashing or currency exchange, to fill out CTRs as a means of protecting against illegal activity like money laundering. Financial transactions totaling at least $10,000 in cash per day—including deposits, withdrawals, or a combination—require a CTR, where the institution must collect and record personal identifying information from the client, like a Social Security or tax ID number. The reports are then sent to FinCEN. (CTRs are different from suspicious activity reports, which are only triggered when a financial institution actively suspects the customer might be doing something illegal.)\n\nThe rule remains in effect in the rest of the country, but in those seven border counties, FinCEN has dropped the reporting threshold from $10,000 to $200. While ATM transactions don't often qualify since they typically have a much lower withdrawal limit, they are technically also subject to the CTR threshold—meaning a $200 cash withdrawal in one of seven counties could soon make one subject to a federal financial report.\n\n\"More than one million Americans are about to face a new level of financial surveillance,\" writes Nicholas Anthony, a policy analyst at the Cato Institute. \"Financial surveillance in the United States has long needed reform, but this move is in the wrong direction.\"\n\n\nAnthony says rather than lowering the threshold, the $10,000 baseline is overdue to be raised.\n\nThe federal government first began requiring banks to log and report all cash transactions of $10,000 or more in 1952. The Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 established CTRs as we know them today, and Treasury regulations enacted in 1972 set the threshold at $10,000.\n\nAs Anthony points out, the $10,000 threshold has remained since that time. If it had been raised even just to keep up with inflation, the current minimum for filing a CTR would be anywhere between $80,000 and $180,000, depending on whether you start from the pre-CTR rules in 1952 or the adoption of the current rules two decades later.\n\nInstead, the CTR minimum has remained the same since it was first enacted, even as the power of the dollar has declined: $10,000 today is equivalent to $1,372 in 1972—a fraction of what the regulation required.\n\nFor this reason, the number of CTRs has ballooned far past the point that any bureaucracy could feasibly find it useful. Last year, FinCEN reported that for FY 2023, businesses and financial institutions filed around 20.8 million CTRs—an average of 57,000 per day.\n\n\n\"Inflation may have contributed to the increase in volume of CTRs filed, which has increased by about 62 percent since fiscal year 2002,\" according to a December 2024 report from the Government Accountability Office. \"The inflation-adjusted threshold in 2023 would have been about $72,880. Using an inflation-adjusted threshold would have reduced the number of CTRs filed by at least 90 percent annually since 2014.\"\n\nThe Trump administration's push to crack down on penny-ante cash transactions is reminiscent of actions the Biden administration attempted.\n\nIn a 2021 bill ostensibly passed to provide relief from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Biden administration included a provision that would require gig economy companies like Uber, eBay, and Etsy to report anyone to the IRS who earned at least $600 per year on their platform—a dramatic cut from the previous minimum of $20,000 per year or 200 transactions.\n\nThe Biden administration also proposed a rule requiring banks to report to the IRS any customers with at least $600 in annual deposits and withdrawals—in other words, nearly everybody. (The IRS has since delayed the gig worker rule, and the Biden administration raised the reporting requirement on the latter from $600 to $10,000 annually.)\n\n\nClearly, the Trump administration is adamant that drug cartels south of the border should be brought to heel—hence the repeated calls by Republicans over the past few years for the U.S. to invade or bomb Mexico. But just as those methods would be an aggressive overreach of U.S. foreign policy, subjecting innumerable law-abiding citizens to additional financial surveillance is an aggressive overreach of fiscal policy.",

        "selftext": "We are considering partnering with Timus Networks for our SASE offering.  It is tempting to consider P81, ZScaler, or Cato, but price of those are extremely high.  Yes, I know you get what you pay for.\n\nWe have used Todyl, and while we like the product, there are just enough issues that we need to reconsider.  Todyl's support, at least for us, has really not met our needs.  Also, the SASE client can take a very long time to connect as well as the issues using it on while on a plane, some hotel WiFi's, and other public networks that have captive portals.\n\nWhen I search Reddit on Timus Networks there really is little information.  The few posts I've seen here are from users who either RARELY post, or they have only posted on SASE threads (and little at that).  While the company is now HQ'ed in the USA, I see that they were previously a company called Berqnet.  I think originally a Turkish company?\n\nI am really hoping that the real members here that have tried to partner with or are partners of Timus Networks would chime in.  How's the product?  Is it stable?  What kind of issues have you experienced?  How's the support and the company customer service in general?  Are they a full-proxy with SSL inspection, or just a DNS filter?  If full proxy, are you able to bypass the SSL inspection/proxy for those sites that are fussy about SSL inspection?\n\nThanks in advance\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "body": "We've been partnered with Timus going on about 10 months. \n\nTo answer the questions from your post:\n\nThe product is stable. I haven't had any reports of users not able to connect through their client to the Timus gateway and from what I've experienced if there is an issue with bandwidth it's on the user's ISP as the Timus gateway provides solid bandwidth.\n\nThe only issues that I've really experienced came from their client dates (pre version 4.0) that wouldn't always automatically update and would have to be kicked off manually and sometimes when the management portal gets updated, it messes with the partner-to-tenant permissions, and you have to select all of them again.\n\nAs far as support goes, as others have stated, a direct slack channel to support and pretty much an \"all hands-on deck\" feel when you reach out to them as they respond and remediate pretty quickly. I reached out about a month ago on a Saturday and had someone on video/screenshare within a few minutes looking into the issue.\n\nIts full SSL inspection with easy certificate deployment directly from their client. I haven't had to bypass any sites thus far so I can't comment on that.\n\nAnother thing that it has done for us is help secure the on-prem network as we no longer have to leave SSLVPN ports open on the firewall as we have a connector (that's free) to go back to the on-prem network over IPSec. \n\nIt also checks the box for MFA through M365/Workspace/Okta, etc. \n\nFor clients that are fully remote or don't have any real on-prem infrastructure like servers, we've shifted to just securing the network at the endpoint.\n\nI'd recommend getting a trial going and check it out to see what you like/don't like.",

A VPN client in some cases is free, but in his case, what is provided by Timus simplified the sale: In most cases the problem was with users remembering how to use other VPN Software, or struggling when they travelled.   This took care of it for them and long term has/will reduce future expenses and increase business revenue.  People working makes more money than people frustated and not working.\n\nSo, I presented an ROI discussion to my clients on how this was actually increasing their bottom line.\n\nThe optional performance tracking is a big sell for some of my clients without any additional costs in licensing.\n\nSo, this has been a win for us and our clients.",

Frustrating,  since as MSPs we need to automate the installation. \n\nFor Active Directory environments, how's the DNS resolution working out?  Any issues?

            "body": "We have been in the same boat. We were pretty heavy Todyl adopters and for a number of reasons we pursued alternatives.  There are some similarities - it is agent-based, there are no physical devices required, set up can be done pretty much on demand, both leverage firewall rules and content filtering. \n\nTimus charges per gateway. Todyl doesn’t unless you want a static IP. In that case, Timus’s static IP is a little less expensive. However, Todyl functions without that. Timus’s WireGuard performance has a little more latency than Todyl’s autobahn network. However, it isn’t noticeable and even for our most noisy SASE client, Timus’s latency hasn’t posed a problem. \n\nWhere Timus differentiated itself is in a few areas. First, per user pricing instead of per device pricing. Second, IPSec tunnels do not carry an extra charge so we don’t have to place agents on servers in order for users to connect to them remotely. Timus has built in security functionality that can be leveraged as IoCs.  Timus also offers us NFRs.  Finally, we have not had nearly as many small issues on Timus as we have had on Todyl. \n\nThis brings me to the biggest differentiator. Todyl’s support really is lacking. You have to submit a ticket and then we found we would have to wait many minutes and repeat troubleshooting tasks to convince them of an issue and we rarely get offered to do a screen share. Timus uses a Slack channel and we get immediate solution oriented support. \n\nWith all of this said, we still like Todyl and use them for some workflow. However, new clients that require SASE will be set up with Timus and SASE clients that have complaints or issues will be transitioned.\n\nHope this helps!",

Everything has been seamless with the setup and any questions are answered insanely quick from our account manager or their support when we reach out. I heard today from one of my senior techs that Timus is his favorite vendor to work with.\n\nDeployment has been a breeze, our office manager is one of the least tech savvy people we know and hates change, I used her as my main test case when doing out proof of concept and just created her account and told her I wasn't going to help her do anything else. She was able to complete her laptop and phone setup without any assistance from anyone. She absolutely loves using Timus instead of VPN with duo.\n\nOur cost along with the per use model instead of having to pay for licenses upfront under a 1 2 or 3 year deal makes it an easy product to make a decent margin on while keeping our clients secure!",

        "title": "Mechanisms of Social Media Manipulation by State and Non-State Actors",
        "selftext": "This report provides a detailed analysis of the tools, actors, and financial networks enabling state and non-state entities to manipulate social media virality and suppress content. It highlights the convergence of marketing and propaganda, with a focus on foreign interference (e.g., Russia, China, Iran) and compromised domestic actors within the U.S. Specific case studies, named entities, and financial pathways are included to illustrate the scale and sophistication of these operations.\n\n---\n\n### **1\\. Mechanisms of Social Media Manipulation**\n\n**a. Algorithmic Exploitation**\n\n- **Platform-Specific Vulnerabilities**:\n\n- **Facebook/Meta**: Exploitation of EdgeRank (content prioritization based on engagement) to amplify divisive content. The 2016 Cambridge Analytica scandal leveraged user data to microtarget voters.\n- **YouTube**: Manipulation of recommendation algorithms to promote extremist content (e.g., 2019 \"Alternative Influence Network\" study).\n- **Twitter/X**: Use of trending topic algorithms to amplify bot-driven hashtags (e.g., Russian troll farm \"Internet Research Agency\" (IRA) campaigns).\n- **Deboosting Tools**:\n\n- Google’s **Jigsaw Unit** developed \"Redirect Method\" to demote extremist content. Critics argue such tools can be co-opted to suppress legitimate dissent.\n\n**b. Microtargeting &amp; Data Harvesting**\n\n- **Key Actors**:\n\n- **ADA AI:** Partnered with DNC for Obama and Hillary campaigns, using large data scrapes and mass privacy invasion to engage in mass persuasion techniques to sway voting.\n- **Cambridge Analytica** (defunct): Partnered with SCL Group to harvest 87 million Facebook profiles, targeting U.S. voters in 2016.\n- **Palantir Technologies**: Provided data analytics to government agencies, raising concerns about dual-use risks for surveillance and propaganda.\n- **Clearview AI**: Facial recognition data sold to entities like the UAE, potentially enabling personalized disinformation.\n- **Marketing Firms as Propaganda Channels**:\n\n- Russian state media **RT (Russia Today)** and **Sputnik** laundered narratives through U.S. marketing firms.\n- China’s **China Daily** and **Xinhua** collaborate with Western PR firms (e.g., **Huntsworth PLC**) to amplify CCP-aligned content.\n\n**c. Strategic Partnerships &amp; Financial Flows**\n\n- **Front Organizations**:\n\n- **Tenet Media** (U.S. front for Russia’s **Social Design Agency**): Funneled $10M to influencers targeting minorities and swing states (WIRED, 2023).\n- **IRA** (Internet Research Agency): Funded by oligarch **Yevgeny Prigozhin**, indicted by the Mueller investigation for 2016 election interference.\n- **Financial Obfuscation**:\n\n- Cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin) used by **North Korea’s Lazarus Group** to fund disinformation campaigns.\n- Shell companies in Cyprus (**Mossack Fonseca**) and Seychelles channel funds to U.S. influencers.\n\n---\n\n### **2\\. Case Studies of Foreign Influence**\n\n**a. Russian Interference**\n\n- **Project Lakhta**: IRA operatives posed as Black Lives Matter activists, amplifying racial tensions via fake accounts (Mueller Report, 2019).\n- **Nexus of Tech and Politics**: **Andrii Derkach** (Ukrainian MP) laundered Kremlin narratives through Rudy Giuliani, influencing 2020 election discourse.\n\n**b. Chinese Influence Operations**\n\n- **United Front Work Department (UFWD)**: Infiltrated diaspora communities via platforms like **WeChat**, censoring criticism of the CCP.\n- **TikTok/ByteDance**: Algorithmic promotion of pro-CCP content (e.g., downplaying Uyghur persecution) while suppressing dissident voices.\n\n**c. Iranian Cyber Influence**\n\n- **Endless Mayfly**: Fake news sites and AI-generated personas targeted U.S. voters in 2020, impersonating Proud Boys and ANTIFA (FireEye, 2020).\n\n### **3\\. Domestic Actors &amp; Content Moderation (Expanded)**\n\n**a. Government-Pressure Dynamics**\n\n- **Agencies Involved**:\n\n- **DHS’s CISA**: Flagged “misinformation” to platforms during COVID-19, drawing criticism from both conservatives (e.g., vaccine skepticism) and progressives (e.g., lab-leak theory suppression).\n- **FBI FITF**: Pushed platforms to suppress stories like the Hunter Biden laptop (alleged Russian disinformation) and, in other cases, anti-BLM narratives.\n\n**b. Domestic Political Manipulation**\n\n- **Conservative-Aligned Groups**:\n\n- **Turning Point USA**: Amplified election fraud claims via meme campaigns.\n- **Project Veritas**: Used covert recordings to discredit media outlets, later amplified by right-wing influencers.\n- **Progressive/Liberal-Aligned Groups**:\n\n- **PACRONYM** (nonprofit): Partnered with **Acronym** (now **FWIW**) to fund **Shadow Inc.**, a tech firm criticized for app failures during the 2020 Iowa caucuses. PACRONYM’s subsidiary **Crooked Media** (Pod Save America) leverages influencer networks to drive voter turnout.\n- **ADA (American Democracy Alliance)**: Progressive dark-money network funding AI-driven microtargeting tools to counter conservative messaging.\n- **Open Society Foundations (OSF)**: Funded research into “hate speech” detection algorithms, which critics argue have been weaponized to silence legitimate political discourse (e.g., labeling gender-critical views as “harmful”).\n- **Bipartisan/Libertarian Actors**:\n\n- **TikTok “News” Creators**: Both progressive and conservative influencers exploit TikTok’s algorithm to spread hyper-partisan content (e.g., pro-Palestine vs. pro-Israel narratives).\n- **FIRE (Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression)**: Criticizes both left- and right-leaning censorship on campuses and social media.\n\n---\n\n### **4\\. Financial Networks &amp; Enablers (Expanded)**\n\n- **Conservative Channels**:\n\n- **DonorsTrust** (dark-money conduit): Funded climate denialism and election-integrity narratives.\n- **The Heritage Foundation**: Lobbied for Section 230 reforms to pressure platforms on “anti-conservative bias.”\n- **Progressive Channels**:\n\n- **New Venture Fund**: Fiscal sponsor for progressive campaigns, including **Disinfo Defense League**, which pressured platforms to deboost “misinformation” tied to racial justice protests.\n- **Pierre Omidyar (eBay)**: Funded **First Draft News**, a now-defunct initiative partnering with platforms to flag “disinformation,” accused of partisan bias.\n- **Cross-Ideological Tech Enablers**:\n\n- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: Hosts Parler (conservative) and **Truthout** (progressive), facing criticism for arbitrary deplatforming.\n- **Neutral “Free Speech” Platforms**: **Rumble** (conservative) and **Bluesky** (progressive) replicate partisan echo chambers despite claims of neutrality.\n\n---\n\n### **5\\. Case Studies of Domestic Influence (Expanded)**\n\n**a. Conservative “Election Integrity” Campaigns**\n\n- **True the Vote**: Promoted debunked claims of 2020 voter fraud via viral documentaries (*2000 Mules*), amplified by **Breitbart** and **Fox News**.\n\n**b. Progressive “Disinformation” Mitigation Efforts**\n\n- **AI Forensics**: Groups like **AlgorithmWatch** and **ADA AI** (Algorithmic Defense Agency) audit platforms for “bias,” but face accusations of conflating conservative speech with harm.\n- **Cyber Civil Rights Initiative**: Lobbied for censorship of “non-consensual intimate imagery,” later expanded to include “misgendering” content.\n\n**c. Libertarian-Led Decentralization**\n\n- **Elon Musk’s Twitter/X**: Accused of boosting right-wing accounts (e.g., **Libs of TikTok**) while suppressing left-wing voices (e.g., **ElonJet tracker**).\n- **Meta’s Oversight Board**: Criticized by both sides for inconsistent rulings (e.g., allowing praise of Kyle Rittenhouse but banning some pro-Hamas content).\n\n---\n\n### **6\\. Recommendations (Revised for Neutrality)**\n\n- **Platform Accountability**:\n\n- **Transparency for All**: Require Meta, Google, and X to disclose *all* government/content moderation requests, whether from DHS, OSF-funded NGOs, or Heritage Foundation affiliates.\n- **Neutral Audits**: Third-party audits of algorithms by ideologically diverse groups (e.g., **FIRE**, **Brennan Center**, **Cato Institute**).\n- **Policy Reforms**:\n\n- Expand **Honest Ads Act** to cover *all* issue-based ads, including climate, racial justice, and election integrity.\n- Revise **FARA** to mandate disclosure by *any* foreign-tied group, including NGOs linked to OSF (Hungary’s criticism of Soros networks) or UAE-funded think tanks.\n- **Public Education**:\n\n- Teach media literacy frameworks that address biases across the spectrum (e.g., *AllSides*, *Ground News*).\n\n---\n\n### **Start Being Adults and Stop Falling for the Same Old Tricks**\n\nSocial media manipulation is not confined to one ideology or nation-state. Foreign actors exploit existing domestic polarization, while **both progressive and conservative entities** weaponize algorithms, data, and financial networks to control narratives. A holistic defense requires depoliticized transparency, equitable enforcement, and recognition that censorship demands from either flank risk eroding civil liberties.",

        "title": "Need help from ABCD community to fix Green Card Backlog",
        "selftext": "This topic was posted a couple times recently by others in brief but it ended up with bickering between ABCDs and FOBs. I am gonna try posting about it again because I think the previous posts were not detailed enough to address misconceptions. I truly believe if we can thoroughly understand each other, we can all be on the same page about the right thing to do. But bear in mind that this will be a long post because detail &amp; precision comes with verbosity.\n\n**Bottom Line On Top:** FOB Indians need support of the ABCD community to help raise voice against &amp; spread awareness about the repressive condition of Indians with an approved immigrant petition waiting for their green card in a backlog caused by discriminatory country-caps that has grown for over 15 years which has now become an exploitative tool for employers, affecting citizens too.\n\nThis post is more about asking for your vocal support &amp; stance towards fixing this discriminatory GC backlog rather than asking for any immediate action. If you are convinced, please do take action to push for reforms; the sooner the better.\n\n\\---\n\n**Situation and How it is Repressive:**\n\nHundreds of thousands of Indian immigrants who are in the US have an *approved* immigrant petition i.e. a petition for Permanent Residency aka a Green Card, but have a wait time of **literally several decades** to actually get the GC. In the mean time, they remain here legally on work-visas like H-1B or L1. Most are on H-1B and I don't really know much about L1 myself (yet) so I won't talk about it.\n\nThe H-1B visa is tied to the employer. That means:\n\n1. They cannot switch jobs easily. They can only work with employers that can file H1B.\n2. They cannot switch roles to outside their STEM field of study.\n3. They cannot be unemployed, else they lose the H1B visa and have to deport.\n   1. If they lose their job they have a grace period of just 60 days to find a new one.\n   2. They cannot take a break from work - eg. for childcare, focusing on a hobby, travel etc.\n4. They cannot hold a second job, and no secondary source of active income. Eg. Cannot drive for Uber, cannot actively make money from YouTube.\n5. Cannot start their own business. Cannot hire workers.\n6. Restrictions on getting promoted to different roles (eg. quality engineer to development engineer) because this resets their place in the green card queue (see next section).\n7. Cannot talk back to employers due to the risk of deportation from losing job. Eg. Can't protest against the boss for overworking, can't protest for underpay, can't press for deserving promotions, can't threaten to quit for exploitation.\n8. They are susceptible to a renewal of the H1b visa being denied for any arbitrary reason every 2-3 yrs at the Consulate window.\n\nThese restrictions may perhaps be understandable for the purpose of temporarily being on a work visa for a few years. However this is where the GC backlog comes in.\n\n**The Discriminatory Green Card Distribution system:**\n\nThe H-1B visa has a term of max 6 yrs, so people come with the understanding that they may have to leave after that, not demanding a green card. If the employer does sponsor a green card for them (through the Employment-Based channel), then once the petition is approved for the GC, H-1B can be renewed indefinitely with the logic being \"because they are already approved for a GC, they're just waiting for adjustment-of-status to Permanent Resident\". The AOS to PR (getting the actual GC) has a queue due to limited number of GCs available per year.  However, there is a country-cap (limit) of 7% of total Employment-Based GCs on each country. This effectively separates the GC queue into multiple queues **segregated based on country-of-birth**.\n\nOnce any country hits that limit, a backlog forms in that country's separate queue. This is where the discrimination comes into play - two persons, equally qualified, doing the same job, when sponsored an EB green card at the same time, have to wait different amount of times based solely on their country-of-birth which is an immutable factor, irrelevant in the EB petition for GC which is supposed to consider only skills of the candidate.\n\nThis violates equality of opportunity at an individual level. This provides reduced opportunity to an individual in a merit-based criterion, discriminating solely on the community that the individual belongs to (Indian origin). **This discrimination based on country-of-birth which is highly correlated with race is literally racism.**\n\n**The Backlog formed due to Segregation:**\n\nBecause more Indians meet the market demand of the current job market in the US than other people from other countries, for whatever reason - higher population or relevancy of skills to the job market -  the queue for Indians is fuller than that for other countries. This backlog has grown over the years as more &amp; more Indians met the job market demands in the US to an amount of roughly 500k primary applicants, and 1 million counting dependent spouses &amp; children. With these numbers, the wait time for anyone who got their petition filed roughly in 2014 onwards has a wait time of more than 10 yrs. My own wait time is 100+ years for a priority date of 2019; so effectively the US has banned me from getting a GC in my life because I was born in India.\n\n**The combination of H1B and GC Backlog:**\n\nNow combine the restrictions of H1B and decades-long wait time; what do you get? Employers have a stream of candidates who have a low negotiating power, low job mobility who can be here forever working for them, waiting for their green card with hopes of fixing the racist system. Thus, indentured-servitude.\n\nIn hiring candidates &amp; petitioning for their GC, employers are prohibited from discriminating based on nationality (rightly so, according to Civil Rights title VII), however the above situation is a clear incentive for employers to covertly prefer hiring GC-backlogged people (Indians) on H1B. Note that this is not to say that Indians who get hired are less qualified or cheap labor\\* - GC petition is a lengthy process that scrutinizes qualifications, skills &amp; relevancy to the job, checks that no American is displaced, and also requires the employer to pay the prevalent wage in that field in that area. Indian workers are also clearly doing their jobs well judging by the growth of the Tech industry filled with them. But given an equally qualified American or any other nationality immigrant, employers might jump hoops to prefer hiring an Indian on H1b (note: speculation, no source). **This now is discrimination against Americans and all other nationalities in being hired.**\n\n\\*\\[After initial offer at prevalent wage, because promotions &amp; subsequent negotiating power is curbed, wages may remain suppressed\\].\n\n**Reasons to support clearing the GC Backlog and Eliminating country-caps in EB category:**\n\n* Eliminate discrimination against Indians in obtaining a green card.\n* Eliminate potential discrimination against Americans &amp; other nationalities in hiring.\n* Provide humane working conditions and equal rights in employment to those currently stuck in this backlog for decades.\n* Prevent exploitation of immigrant workers by employers.\n* Make green card distribution equitable.\n* Promote investment, job creation, economic growth by freeing up backlogged employer-tied population.\n* Prevent aging out kids of Indian immigrants.\n\n**The Fight for Reforms:**\n\nAs you can see, the system is heavily stacked against Indian immigrants who have to be on a work visa with no voting rights. Because they're on a visa, they have limited power in influencing legislation. This is why we need your support, ABCDs! You are the Americans who are the closest representation for Indian immigrants by virtue of our shared heritage, some culture and ethnicity.\n\nI think the issues listed above are bad enough that any progressive person who supports equality, regardless of their background, would join the fight for the reforms. However, this issue has very limited visibility currently. That's a reason for spreading more awareness.\n\nAdditionally because of the perception of Indians being in well-paying jobs, there is a lack of interest in understanding what their real plight is. But that does not mean their plight is undeserving of sympathy or improvement. Also, not all Indians work in high paying Big Tech jobs or Medicine; there are hundreds of thousands of Indians who work in other STEM fields like other fields of engineering, healthcare, or even smaller tech jobs that pay close to the median income.\n\nIt is suspected that American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) oppose clearing out the GC Backlog because they make over a billion dollars annually in H1b renewal fees of Indians stuck in the backlog. Corporations dependent on H1b workers might also be covertly *opposing* the reform due to above mentioned incentives. **Your support is thus crucial in this uphill battle**.\n\n**So, I ask you to please:**\n\n* Proactively support immigration reforms to clear this discriminatory backlog.\n* Be vocal in raising awareness to this problem that affects everyone - Indians, Americans and other nationalities. It deserves to be a mainstream issue at this point after years of buildup.\n* Help with lobbying and other direct action for legislative reforms which cannot be conducted by visa-holders.\n\n**Current Reforms to Support &amp; Participate in:**\n\n* Build Back Better Act, House draft have provisions 60002-60005 that will address all these issues.\n   * 60002: Recapture 400k wasted GCs since 1992\n   * 60003: Allow early AOS for approved petitions &amp; exemption from country-caps for a fee.\n   * Read about it [here](https://www.cato.org/blog/build-back-better-act-immigration-provisions-summary-analysis). For action, join this [telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/IhD4czsLtNYzNjM5), or join efforts with [ImmigrationVoice](https://immigrationvoice.org/).\n   * This is in critical stage for action.\n* [EAGLE Act](https://eagleact.info/) \\- Eliminates country-caps.\n\n**Read More:**\n\n* [CATO: Immigration Wait Times from Quotas Have Doubled: Green Card Backlogs Are Long, Growing, and Inequitable](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/immigration-wait-times-quotas-have-doubled-green-card-backlogs-are-long)\n* [Similar explanation on SIIA website](http://7monthsvs70years.siia.us/)\n\n\\---\n\nEDIT: Adding an account of the human impact of this GC limbo.\n\n**Human Impact of the long GC Limbo:**\n\nIf you are born in the wrong country, i.e. a country with a large population of English speakers and computer skills:\n\n1 You will be officially systemically discriminated to never get a GC / citizenship in your lifetime. People will fail to even recognize this discrimination because it is embedded in the \\[arcane\\] laws and is not a popular issue yet.\n\n2 You will always be treated as a commodity as in your existence is only tolerated and tied with your employment, irrespective of your contribution, taxes, and achievements.\n\n3 You are not allowed to travel freely to your home country; your parents' health be damned! If you have NRI friends, ask them how many funerals they have missed!\n\nWhile you are in this GC limbo, the work visa has to be renewed every 2-3 years. Each time, you have to get it re-stamped from India to be able to enter US. So all international travel windows are hostages to visa renewal appointment availabilities in India &amp; rigid timelines of renewal. At the appointment you are treated like a temporary worker every time even if you have been working in the US for several years with an approved GC petition, and could get denied by an arbitrary window officer, upon which you have to deport your family from US.\n\n4. When your dependent spouse's H4-EAD (dependent visa work authorization) is revoked (which is constantly in peril), your spouse cannot work for the rest of their life, irrespective of their qualification. Most dependent spouses in this backlog are Indian women. So it fails woman empowerment.\n\n5. If you have small kids when you move here, they will have to move out of the country (legal immigrant children are not protected by DACA, only children of illegal immigrants are) when they become adults, and may only come back here as a foreign student who can only be at best in the same situation as you are but they can never be a citizen.\n\n6. If you lose your job for any reason, (sickness, accident, layoffs) uproot from here and get the hell out of this country in 60 days you moochers! Who wants bloodsuckers like you here, after paying taxes most of your adult life. Same thing if you die; your family has to self-deport all because you were born in the wrong country. Btw, this includes the death of doctors and nurses on H1B waiting for their GC who died fighting COVID-19 for ALL of us.\n\nHere's a few examples of deaths of Indians in the GC limbo whose families had to deport because they did not receive their GC in time just because they were Indian:\n\n* [https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/archive/diaspora/death-of-indian-techie-on-us-green-card-waiting-forces-pregnant-wife-to-return-home-855359](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/archive/diaspora/death-of-indian-techie-on-us-green-card-waiting-forces-pregnant-wife-to-return-home-855359)\n* [https://www.kansascity.com/opinion/readers-opinion/guest-commentary/article236572298.html](https://www.kansascity.com/opinion/readers-opinion/guest-commentary/article236572298.html)\n* [https://www.indiawest.com/news/global\\_indian/h-1b-engineer-dies-of-heart-attack-leaving-family-vulnerable-to-immediate-deportation-to-india/article\\_2bdc256a-f9ae-11eb-acf7-cb6aa459cc99.html](https://www.indiawest.com/news/global_indian/h-1b-engineer-dies-of-heart-attack-leaving-family-vulnerable-to-immediate-deportation-to-india/article_2bdc256a-f9ae-11eb-acf7-cb6aa459cc99.html)\n* [https://www.americanbazaaronline.com/2019/10/21/indian-national-stuck-in-green-card-limbo-forced-to-return-after-her-husbands-death-439102/](https://www.americanbazaaronline.com/2019/10/21/indian-national-stuck-in-green-card-limbo-forced-to-return-after-her-husbands-death-439102/)\n\n7 You cannot start a business; you exist only because of your quasi-\"temporary\" employment, remember? You or your kids are not allowed any side income (book royalty, lemonade stand, start-ups, freelancing, artistry sale, teaching math or robotics club .. no, nothing... nada)\n\nYou see, the bill of rights, the pursuit of happiness, freedom etc are simply not applicable to you. You exist because we have a slight skill shortage.\n\nThis is the situation for over 1 million people. But of course, the media does not acknowledge it as a civil right issue. Their sob stories are not as alluring on TV as refugees, not enough violence and horrors for TV footages. Of course, politicians don't care. You cannot vote or even provide campaign contributions by law. Neither do employers care,.. I mean, who wants to give these people more job mobility?\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**FAQs:**\n\nQ1. Since it is so repressive, why don't you go back to India or elsewhere?\n\n\\&gt; Ignoring the analogy of this question to a racist White person telling you to go back -\n\nYes I might. I am in my early 30s without a house or kids so I have more flexibility. But many people have laid down roots here already who do not have that flexibility.\n\nI too have been here for 8+ yrs with a friend circle &amp; a support network in the country, so it is hard to leave that. More importantly, I see a clear discrimination and violation of equality, and along with possibilities of reforms, it gives me hope to improve the system, and get what my qualification deserves.\n\nAlso, it's like a slow poison. Life is decent, we're making above-median salary, we're in the \"greatest\" country in the world, but it is slowly chipping away at us, depriving us of some freedom, entrepreneurship, creativity, community involvement, assimilation &amp; acceptance.\n\nLastly, if all the backlogged people decided to leave, no one would leave because game theory; it is not a feasible solution.\n\nQ2. Won't Indians dominate green cards resulting in lack of diversity if country caps are removed?\n\n\\&gt; The argument I make is limited to the Employment-based category of Green Cards which is just 14% of the total number of GCs available annually. Employment opportunities are based on market supply demand dynamics. Just because currently Indians satisfy the tech demand does not mean this will always be the case. Enforcing \"diversity\" on employment visas rather results in violation of equality of opportunity based on merit as explained above.\n\nMoreover, you can question, diversity of what? Diversity of culture? Diversity of race? Diversity of language? Diversity of socioeconomic status?\n\nCountries are not necessarily homogenous in their demographics. eg. India itself has many distinct languages, different cultures, different ethnicities, different races too. South Africa, Indonesia etc also rank high in diversity. So even if the argument is to control for diversity of demographics, country-of-birth based caps make no sense.\n\nQ3. Why would you come to the US in the first place if it is so bad?\n\n\\&gt; Generally Indians do not know how bad it is before coming here. Also, the situation got much worse over the last decade. More importantly though, every few years, there have been potential immigration reforms on the table which would fix this which gives hope. Only after living here for many years do you realize that it's a dangling carrot in front of you. Classic exploitation technique. If I had known this before I came to the US, clearly I would not have come, and I know most others wouldn't have either. For after we come here, see my answers for Q1.",

ABDs are citizens of the US, and like any other citizen they should make the decision that is in the best interest of the country. Blindly supporting someone because they came from the same country as your parents is the polar opposite of making a well-informed decision. Every country prioritizes the interests of its own people, the US isn’t special in any way. \n\nIt’s great that you and your family were able to become citizens, but they did so by going through the same immigration process as everyone else and likely faced their own struggles during that time. Adult immigrants are well aware of how immigration processes in other countries work and if they just choose to migrate regardless they can’t push the blame onto the host country when their future becomes uncertain. The only people who aren’t themselves responsible for being in this situation are legal dreamers, and they shouldn’t be held accountable for the actions of their parents. This post isn’t about that though it’s just an essay full of “woe is me the system is unfair and discriminatory” (when it really isn’t).",

People will fail to even recognize this discrimination because it is embedded in the \\[arcane\\] laws and is not a popular issue yet.\n\n2 You will always be treated as a commodity as in your existence is only tolerated and tied with your employment, irrespective of your contribution, taxes, and achievements.\n\n3 You are not allowed to travel freely to your home country; your parents' health be damned! If you have NRI friends, ask them how many funerals they have missed!\n\nWhile you are in this GC limbo, the work visa has to be renewed every 2-3 years. Each time, you have to get it re-stamped from India to be able to enter US. So all international travel windows are hostages to visa renewal appointment availabilities in India &amp; rigid timelines of renewal. At the appointment you are treated like a temporary worker every time even if you have been working in the US for several years with an approved GC petition, and could get denied by an arbitrary window officer, upon which you have to deport your family from US.\n\n4) When your dependent spouse's H4-EAD (dependent visa work authorization) is revoked (which is constantly in peril), your spouse cannot work for the rest of their life, irrespective of their qualification. Most dependent spouses in this backlog are Indian women. So it fails woman empowerment.\n\n5) If you have small kids when you move here, they will have to move out of the country (legal immigrant children are not protected by DACA, only children of illegal immigrants are) when they become adults, and may only come back here as a foreign student who can only be at best in the same situation as you are but they can never be a citizen.\n\n6) If you lose your job for any reason, (sickness, accident, layoffs) uproot from here and get the hell out of this country in 60 days you moochers! Who wants bloodsuckers like you here, after paying taxes most of your adult life. Same thing if you die; your family has to self-deport all because you were born in the wrong country. Btw, this includes the death of doctors and nurses on H1B waiting for their GC who died fighting COVID-19 for ALL of us.\n\nHere's a few examples of deaths of Indians in the GC limbo whose families had to deport because they did not receive their GC in time just because they were Indian:\n\n* [https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/archive/diaspora/death-of-indian-techie-on-us-green-card-waiting-forces-pregnant-wife-to-return-home-855359](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/archive/diaspora/death-of-indian-techie-on-us-green-card-waiting-forces-pregnant-wife-to-return-home-855359)\n* [https://www.kansascity.com/opinion/readers-opinion/guest-commentary/article236572298.html](https://www.kansascity.com/opinion/readers-opinion/guest-commentary/article236572298.html)\n* [https://www.indiawest.com/news/global\\_indian/h-1b-engineer-dies-of-heart-attack-leaving-family-vulnerable-to-immediate-deportation-to-india/article\\_2bdc256a-f9ae-11eb-acf7-cb6aa459cc99.html](https://www.indiawest.com/news/global_indian/h-1b-engineer-dies-of-heart-attack-leaving-family-vulnerable-to-immediate-deportation-to-india/article_2bdc256a-f9ae-11eb-acf7-cb6aa459cc99.html)\n* [https://www.americanbazaaronline.com/2019/10/21/indian-national-stuck-in-green-card-limbo-forced-to-return-after-her-husbands-death-439102/](https://www.americanbazaaronline.com/2019/10/21/indian-national-stuck-in-green-card-limbo-forced-to-return-after-her-husbands-death-439102/)\n\n7 You cannot start a business; you exist only because of your quasi-\"temporary\" employment, remember? You or your kids are not allowed any side income (book royalty, lemonade stand, start-ups, freelancing, artistry sale, teaching math or robotics club .. no, nothing... nada)\n\nYou see, the bill of rights, the pursuit of happiness, freedom etc are simply not applicable to you. You exist because we have a slight skill shortage.\n\nThis is the situation for over 1 million people. But of course, the media does not acknowledge it as a civil right issue. Their sob stories are not as alluring on TV as refugees, not enough violence and horrors for TV footages. Of course, politicians don't care. You cannot vote or even provide campaign contributions by law. Neither do employers care,.. I mean, who wants to give these people more job mobility?",

All developed nations have a declining working population and the only way for them to survive in the long run is to have immigrants coming in. Ideally these developing nations want the most educated immigrants so that they have to spend the least money in educating them and then reap the most tax benefits during their working lives. In return US would be giving these immigrants much hire standard of living. In terms of this framework US is lagging behind other developed nations like Australia, NZ and Canada etc. who have much more open immigration policies as they have realized the problem they are facing.\n\nI personally won't call the current laws racist or segregationist as the original intent of these laws wasn't to distinguish between people. That's just something that US decided to do and I believe it's their right to decide which people come to their country. More indians becoming eligible for H1B jobs is no achievement, most who become eligible for these positions are themselves (including me) product of caste privilege that they have enjoyed in India. Being 'meritorious' doesn't give every H1B holder a right to become a US citizen. Ofcourse we would like that :), but it's the decision of the citizens of USA.\n\nSo I think it is just beneficial for US to give people GCs so they can express their economic potential to the fullest extent and thus benefit US in the long term. Similarly they should also increase the number of H1B visas issued per year.",

At this moment, the Build Back Better Act is a hope to [include immigration reforms](https://www.cato.org/blog/build-back-better-act-immigration-provisions-summary-analysis) which has passed the House in November. Senate Dems are working on including the section (60001) that provides relief to undocumented immigrants, but they have not yet worked on the sections (60002/3) that help clear the GC backlog for documented immigrants. Senator Durbin (D-IL) is the bottleneck who seems to want to include (60002/3) only if (60001) gets approved. It would help if you can call Sen Durbin (DC: 202-224-2152) and just ask him to support the sections 60002/3 and make a public statement saying he will work in good faith to pass them.\n\nLong term, [ImmigrationVoice.org](https://ImmigrationVoice.org) is the only organization that is working towards this cause since 15 yrs. You can make a donation on the website. They do some [lobbying work](https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/clients/summary?cycle=2021&amp;id=F194104) from the contribution money.

        "selftext": "\n**A newly discovered IoT botnet named Ballista is exploiting vulnerabilities in TP-Link Archer routers and is associated with an unnamed Italian threat actor.**\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- Ballista exploits a vulnerability tracked as CVE-2023-1389, originally revealed during a hacking competition.\n- The botnet has been linked to attacks on organizations across several countries, including the US and Australia.\n- More than 6,000 internet-exposed devices may be vulnerable to this botnet's attacks.\n- The malware establishes a command and control channel to manipulate compromised devices for malicious activities.\n\nCato Networks recently identified Ballista, a new IoT botnet that specifically targets TP-Link Archer routers by taking advantage of a vulnerability known as CVE-2023-1389. This vulnerability was first disclosed during a Pwn2Own hacker competition held in late 2022 and has been exploited by various botnets since. The connection between Ballista and an unnamed Italian threat actor has been established with moderate confidence based on specific patterns in malware binaries and IP addresses. The botnet first surfaced in January 2025, with adverse activities observed shortly thereafter, suggesting it remains operational in the wild.\n\nThe Ballista botnet is particularly concerning because it targets a significant number of devices globally, including those in critical sectors such as manufacturing, healthcare, services, and technology. With over 6,000 devices potentially exposed to this botnet, organizations in areas like the US, Australia, China, and Mexico need to be vigilant. Upon successfully exploiting a vulnerable router, Ballista downloads a malicious payload that sets up an encrypted command and control channel. This enables the attackers to execute command-line instructions, spread the malware further, and even launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks while trying to evade detection by modifying download sources to use Tor domains for better concealment.\n\nWhat steps should organizations take to secure their devices against emerging IoT threats like the Ballista botnet?\n\n**Learn More:** [Security Week](https://www.securityweek.com/new-ballista-iot-botnet-linked-to-italian-threat-actor/)\n\n**Want to stay updated on the latest cyber threats?** \n\n 👉 **[Subscribe to /r/PwnHub](https://www.reddit.com/r/pwnhub)**",

        "selftext": "# Implications Theodore Porter’s Thinking in Psychotherapy and Mental Health\n\n\n\n# Who is Theodore Porter?\n\nIn his seminal work “Trust in Numbers: The Pursuit of Objectivity in Science and Public Life,” historian of science Theodore Porter offers a compelling analysis of the rise and cultural authority of quantitative methods in modern society. Porter challenges the prevailing assumption that the power and prestige of numbers derive solely from their success in the natural sciences. Instead, he argues that to fully understand the ubiquity of quantification, we must examine its ascendancy in the social realms of business, government, and public policy.\n\nPorter’s central thesis is that quantitative objectivity emerged not as an inherent feature of scientific progress, but as a “technology of distance” – a strategy for communicating across expanding social networks whose members could no longer rely on personal trust and reputation alone. The authority of numbers, he contends, is deeply entwined with the social contexts in which quantification is deployed, particularly when expert judgment is challenged and credibility is in doubt. Through a wide-ranging exploration of fields such as accounting, insurance, cost-benefit analysis, and engineering, Porter reveals how the ideal of mechanical objectivity often serves as a bulwark against accusations of arbitrariness or bias when decision-makers face external political pressures and a breakdown of trust.\n\n# The Facade of Neutrality\n\nWhile Porter acknowledges the genuine achievements of quantitative methods, he cautions against the temptation to view them as a panacea for the messy [realities of social and political life](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/4777-2/). The very ideal of a “view from nowhere,” purged of individual discretion and judgment, can easily become a smokescreen for the subtle manipulations of entrenched power. Under the guise of impartial, [evidence-based reasoning](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/when-evidence-based-practice-goes-wrong/), [bureaucratic hierarchies](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/fixing-evidence-based-practice/) and c[orporate interests](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/corporatization-of-psychotherapy/) can shape the [epistemic assumptions,](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/the-participatory-poetics-of-metamodern-language-and-culture/) methodological conventions, and discursive constraints that govern the production of quantitative knowledge.\n\nThis illusion of neutrality is perhaps most apparent in the realm of public policy, where the language of numbers is routinely invoked to justify controversial decisions and foreclosure of alternatives. Porter points to the rise of cost-benefit analysis as a prime example of how the narrow logic of economic quantification can steamroll ethical and ideological differences in the name of an “optimal” solution. By translating complex trade-offs between incommensurable values into a common metric of dollars and cents, policy-makers can lend an air of objective validity to what are ultimately political judgments about the distribution of risks and rewards across society.\n\nSimilarly, the proliferation of quantitative benchmarks and performance metrics in domains such as education and healthcare can serve to reinforce status quo power relations while disavowing the role of human agency and responsibility. The seductive appeal of “letting the numbers speak for themselves” can discourage critical interrogation of the value-laden assumptions built into evaluative rubrics and data collection processes. In this way, the pursuit of standardization and algorithmic decision-making can end up marginalizing forms of knowledge and experience that resist easy quantification, such as narrative, affect, and embodied wisdom.\n\n# Medicine: Evidence-Based or Industry-Driven?\n\nThe field of medicine provides a cautionary case study in the limits and pitfalls of quantitative objectivity. In recent decades, the ideal of evidence-based medicine (EBM) has gained increasing traction as a corrective to the traditional reliance on individual clinical expertise. Proponents of EBM argue that medical decision-making should be guided by systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses rather than anecdotal experience or expert opinion. This shift towards quantitative empiricism was partly a response to growing public skepticism towards medical authority in the wake of scandals over industry influence and conflicts of interest.\n\nHowever, as Porter’s analysis suggests, the rhetoric of EBM can also serve to mask the persistence of bias and the distortions of market forces in shaping medical knowledge and practice. The [STAR\\*D study](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/when-evidence-based-practice-goes-wrong/), a massive clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of antidepressant medications, illustrates the ways in which the presumed objectivity of q[uantitative evidence can be undermined by methodological choices](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/can-psychotherapy-survive-seperated-from-anthropology-and-philosophy/) and reporting practices. Despite its rigorous statistical methodology, the study has been criticized for its reliance on industry funding, selective publication of favorable results, and failure to adequately control for placebo effects. The aura of scientific validity conferred by the study’s quantitative framework has been invoked to justify the widespread prescription of antidepressants, even as questions remain about their efficacy and safety, particularly for mild to moderate depression.\n\nOn a broader level, the EBM paradigm risks neglecting crucial contextual factors that shape health outcomes, such as patient preferences, social determinants, and the therapeutic alliance. The drive to eliminate variations in care through rigid adherence to standardized guidelines can undermine the flexibility and judgment needed to tailor treatments to individual needs. Moreover, the emphasis on quantifiable outcomes may marginalize forms of care that resist easy measurement, such as empathy, narrative understanding, and holistic consideration of patient well-being. In this way, the uncritical pursuit of quantitative objectivity in medicine can ironically lead to a reductionist and dehumanizing view of the healing process.\n\n# Politics: The Quantitative Rhetoric of the Center\n\nIn the political sphere, the ideal of [quantitative objectivity has increasingly been mobilized to justify a narrow spectrum of centrist policy options](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/healing-the-modern-soul-part-2/) while foreclosing more expansive visions of social transformation. In recent years, the Democratic Party in the United States has embraced a technocratic, data-driven approach to governance that purports to transcend ideological differences through pragmatic problem-solving. This quantitative centrism is epitomized by the rise of figures such as Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, who have championed policies such as welfare reform, financial deregulation, and market-based healthcare on the grounds of economic efficiency and evidence-based policymaking.\n\nHowever, as Porter’s analysis suggests, this fetishization of quantitative expertise can serve to mask the value judgments and p[ower dynamics that shape political choices](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/anticipating-the-meta-modern-what-comes-after-the-post-modern/). By framing social issues in the technical language of cost-benefit analysis and statistical risk assessment, centrist Democrats have often shifted the Overton window to the right, legitimating the erosion of the welfare state and the marketization of public goods. The presumption that the correct policy must always lie somewhere in the [middle of two extremes](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/politics-trauma-and-psychology-oh-my/) can have the effect of marginalizing more progressive or transformative ideas as unrealistic or utopian.\n\nConservative and libertarian think tanks have weaponized the rhetoric of quantitative objectivity to provide an epistemic gloss to their preferred policy agendas. Organizations such as the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute, and the Manhattan Institute have produced a deluge of studies, reports, and policy briefs that use economic modeling, regression analysis, and other quantitative techniques to argue for tax cuts, deregulation, and the privatization of government services. By clothing their arguments in the garb of value-neutral science, these groups can lend an air of empirical legitimacy to what are ultimately contestable ideological positions.\n\nAmericas obsession with evidence based practice have allowed nefarious forces to turn our conception of economics into ideology plus math and our preference for evidence based practice into science flavored capitalism.\n\n# Psychology: The Violence of Pure Empiricism\n\nPerhaps the most troubling misapplication of quantitative objectivity can be found in the field of psychology, where the demand for complete empirical verification of mental phenomena can end up doing epistemic violence to the very subject matter it purports to illuminate. As a discipline concerned with the intricacies of human subjectivity and the interpreted nature of personal experience, psychology has long struggled to reconcile its scientific aspirations with the irreducible complexity of the mind. While quantitative methods have yielded important insights in domains such as cognitive neuroscience and behavioral genetics, the drive to operationalize every aspect of mental life into measurable variables can lead to a flattening and fragmenting of the psyche.\n\nThe dark side of psychology’s quantitative turn is perhaps most evident in the history of psychological [testing and assessment](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/the-failure-of-evidence-based-incentive-structure/). From the early 20th century onwards, the proliferation of standardized instruments such as IQ tests, personality inventories, and diagnostic questionnaires has often served to reify cultural stereotypes and legitimate the ranking of human worth along a single quantitative dimension. The aura of scientific objectivity conferred by numerical scores and statistical norms can mask the value-laden assumptions and interpretive judgments that are baked into these tools from the start. In this way, the quantitative gaze of psychology can end up [pathologizing difference, decontextualizing distress, and reducing the rich tapestry of human experience t](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/the-bridge-between-ancient-wisdom-and-modern-practice/)o a set of measurable deficits and abnormalities.\n\nMoreover, as Porter argues, the ideal of quantitative objectivity as a “view from nowhere” emerged historically as a defensive response to the erosion of personal trust and the growth of impersonal bureaucracy. When this standpoint of detached, suspicious observation is turned reflexively back onto the [self](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/healing-the-modern-soul-part-3/), it can lead to a profound alienation from one’s own inner life. The demand for complete third-person verification of every subjective claim can end up invalidating the epistemic authority of first-person experience, feeling, and intuition. By imposing the same norms of standardization and control on the mind that we apply to the natural world, we risk losing touch with the very qualities that make us human – our capacity for meaning-making, imagination, and empathic understanding.\n\nThis is not to suggest that psychology should abandon the pursuit of empirical rigor or eschew quantitative methods altogether. Rather, as Porter’s analysis implies, we need to cultivate a more reflexive and pluralistic understanding of what counts as valid psychological knowledge. This means recognizing the cultural and historical specificity of our methodological assumptions, the value-ladenness of our interpretive frameworks, and the ineradicable role of the human subject in the construction of psychological truth. It means acknowledging the epistemic limits of quantification and the importance of other modes of inquiry, such as qualitative interviews, focus groups, and first-person phenomenology. Above all, it means approaching the study of the mind with an attitude of humility, curiosity, and openness to the irreducible otherness of human experience.\n\n# Porter’s Ideas Compared to Other Critics of Rationalizism and Empericism\n\nTheodore Porter’s critique of quantification and objectivity has intriguing parallels and contrasts with the ideas of several other prominent thinkers who have examined the impact of technology, media, and bureaucracy on modern society.\n\n# Adam Curtis and the Critique of Computer-Based Societal Modeling\n\nBritish documentary filmmaker [Adam Curtis](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/adam-curtis-thesis-less-documentarian-and-art-films-that-are-more-than-journalism/) has argued that the increasing use of computers and data analysis in the late 20th century gave rise to a misguided belief that society could be perfectly understood and modeled using mathematical and computational methods. In his 2011 series “All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace,” Curtis suggests that this “cybernetic” view of the world, promoted by thinkers like Ayn Rand and Alan Greenspan, led to a misplaced faith in the power of markets and technology to solve social problems.\n\nPorter’s work resonates with Curtis’s critique in its skepticism towards the assumption that quantitative methods can provide a fully objective and comprehensive understanding of complex human realities. Both thinkers highlight the ways in which the appeal of numbers and data can obscure the subjective judgments and political interests that shape their application.\n\nHowever, while Curtis emphasizes the role of computers and cybernetics in promoting a mechanistic view of society, Porter’s analysis focuses more on the institutional and professional contexts that drive the pursuit of quantification. Porter’s distinction between mechanical and disciplinary objectivity suggests that the rise of numerical methods cannot be attributed solely to technological developments, but also reflects the social and political imperatives of bureaucracies and expert communities.\n\n# Jean Baudrillard and the Simulacra\n\nThe French philosopher and cultural theorist [Jean Baudrillard](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/jean-baudrillard-philosopher-of-hyperreality-and-simulation/) is known for his concept of “simulacra” – representations that have become detached from reality and taken on a life of their own. In his book “Simulacra and Simulation” (1981), Baudrillard argues that in the [postmodern](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/metamodernism-and-the-future-of-psychotherapy-integrating-modernity-postmodernity-and-the-therapeutic-encounter/) era, signs and images have lost their connection to real-world referents, creating a hyperreal world where simulation is more powerful than reality.\n\nBaudrillard’s ideas have intriguing implications for Porter’s critique of quantification. From a Baudrillardian perspective, the proliferation of numerical indicators and statistical models could be seen as a form of simulacra – abstract representations that have become more “real” than the complex social phenomena they purport to describe. The use of quantitative measures in fields like economics, policy, and mental health could be seen as creating a hyperreal world where decisions are based on simplified numerical proxies rather than direct engagement with human realities.\n\nHowever, while Baudrillard’s work often emphasizes the seductive power of simulation and the impossibility of accessing the “real,” Porter’s analysis suggests that quantification is always shaped by social and political contexts. Rather than seeing numbers as fully detached from reality, Porter emphasizes the ways in which quantitative methods are embedded in networks of expertise, accountability, and trust.\n\n# The Situationists and the Spectacle of Quantification\n\nThe [Situationist International](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/the-situationist-international-subversive-tricksters-of-everyday-life/) was a group of radical artists and theorists active in the 1950s and 60s, known for their critique of consumer capitalism and their advocacy of revolutionary social change. One of the key concepts developed by the Situationists was the idea of the “spectacle” – a term used to describe the way in which modern media and advertising create a false, alienated representation of reality that distracts from authentic human experience.\n\nThe Situationist critique of the spectacle has some intriguing parallels with Porter’s analysis of quantification. Just as the spectacle reduces human life to a series of commodified images, the proliferation of numerical indicators and statistical models could be seen as creating a kind of “spectacle of objectivity” – a seductive but ultimately alienating representation of social reality.\n\nHowever, while the Situationists emphasized the need for radical social and political transformation to overcome the spectacle, Porter’s work suggests that the pursuit of quantification is deeply embedded in the structures and practices of modern institutions. Rather than advocating for a complete rejection of numerical methods, Porter’s analysis invites a more nuanced consideration of how quantitative tools can be used in ways that are transparent, accountable, and responsive to human contexts.\n\n# Nietzsche and the Rational\n\nOne important point of comparison is with the work of [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/friedrich-nietzsches-profound-impact-on-psychology-psychotherapy-and-the-conceptualization-of-trauma/), whose genealogical approach to the history of ideas shares with Porter a skepticism towards claims of pure objectivity. Nietzsche’s critique of scientific rationality as a form of asceticism and self-denial, driven by a “will to truth” that serves particular interests and values, anticipates Porter’s examination of the moral and political dimensions of quantification. Like Porter, Nietzsche emphasizes the historical and psychological contingency of knowledge practices, revealing the ways in which the pursuit of truth is always entangled with questions of power and desire.\n\nHowever, Nietzsche’s critique is arguably more radical and far-reaching than Porter’s, calling into question the very value of objectivity and suggesting that all knowledge claims are ultimately expressions of a will to power. While Porter’s analysis is more focused on the specific contexts and practices of quantification, Nietzsche’s genealogical method aims to uncover the deeper moral and metaphysical roots of scientific thinking itself.\n\n# Michel Foucault and the Social Objective\n\nAnother key thinker whose work intersects with Porter’s is [Michel Foucault](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/post-freudian-psychoanalysis-ronald-fairbairn/), particularly in his analyses of the relationship between knowledge and power. Foucault’s concept of the “power/knowledge nexus” emphasizes the ways in which the production of knowledge is always intertwined with networks of power relations, shaping the possibilities for thought and action in a given historical moment. This perspective resonates with Porter’s examination of how quantitative methods have been employed in the service of bureaucratic administration and governance, from public health and education to criminal justice and social welfare.\n\nLike Porter, Foucault is attentive to the role of quantification in the management of populations and the disciplining of individual subjectivities. He shows how statistical norms and standards, presented as objective and neutral, can function as instruments of power, shaping the ways in which people understand and govern themselves. At the same time, Foucault’s work encompasses a broader range of knowledge practices and power relations than Porter’s more specific focus on quantification, and his emphasis on the ontological and political effects of knowledge production differs from Porter’s more epistemological and professional concerns.\n\nMichel Foucalt\n\n# Legacy of Porter’s Ideas\n\nTheodore Porter’s critique of quantification offers a valuable perspective for examining the use of numerical methods in psychotherapy and mental health. His work challenges the assumption that quantification is inherently objective and neutral, highlighting the social, political, and institutional factors that shape the application of statistics and standardized procedures.\n\nIn the context of psychotherapy, Porter’s ideas invite a critical reflection on the evidence-based practice movement, diagnostic systems, and the therapeutic relationship. While quantitative methods can provide important insights and support accountability, an overreliance on these approaches can also constrain the understanding and treatment of psychological distress.\n\nAs the mental health field grapples with the challenges of providing effective, equitable, and humane care, engaging with Porter’s work can inform the development of more nuanced and contextually-sensitive approaches. This may involve balancing the use of standardized interventions with the cultivation of clinical judgment, attending to the social and cultural determinants of mental health, and prioritizing the therapeutic alliance as a key factor in outcomes.\n\nUltimately, a critical understanding of the role of quantification in psychotherapy can support the delivery of care that is both evidence-based and person-centered, and that honors the complexity and diversity of human experience.\n\n# References:\n\nPorter, T.

Therapists work with individuals, not abstractions like “the average member of X group.” While quantitative methods are indispensable, they must be balanced with qualitative outcomes. Funnily enough, this aligns with what radical behaviorists have long argued for (though often failed to achieve): the need to center experience and behavior as the target of research and intervention.\n\nQuantifying is crucial, but as Marx and Engels noted, qualitative changes can transform into quantitative ones. The problem arises when therapists misinterpret critiques of quantitative methods as a license to reject them outright in favor of “clinical judgment,” a concept largely debunked as unreliable. It’s this kind of binary thinking—rejecting half of a complex picture—that leads to the current issues in quantification.\n\nUltimately, the goal of science in clinical work isn’t to merely apply an existing body of knowledge to one’s work but to apply scientific principles to the work itself. Measurement or tracking of SOME kind is invaluable, not only for holding oneself accountable to actual outcomes (as opposed to the typically imagined ones) but also for better understanding and refining one’s own processes as a therapist or an active agent in the world.",
