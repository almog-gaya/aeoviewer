    "response_text": "Commercial property managers face several challenges in leveraging data analytics for decision-making, primarily stemming from data accessibility, skills gaps, and integration complexities.  Many existing property management systems lack robust analytics capabilities or offer data in inaccessible formats, hindering effective analysis.  Furthermore, a shortage of personnel with the necessary data analysis skills to interpret complex datasets and translate insights into actionable strategies poses a significant barrier.  Finally, integrating disparate data sources – such as accounting software, maintenance platforms, and tenant databases – creates a significant hurdle in creating a comprehensive view of portfolio performance.  These limitations prevent property managers from fully utilizing the potential of data analytics for optimization and informed decision-making.\n\n###SENTIMENTS: 0.7\n",
