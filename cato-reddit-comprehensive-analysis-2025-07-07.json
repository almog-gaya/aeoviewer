Cato - no idea although I believe Netskope has almost 50% more POPs (130 vs 170) but check this. \n\nRegardless it was a huge challenge to implement. Make sure you get good support from the vendor during your rollout. Take a look at their Dedicated IPs offering, expensive but much more reliable for critical apps. Once you have it in, the visibility is next level - the TLS interception massively helps with threat detection. So much visibility and control. Good luck with your journey 👍",

Each supplier is going to do it's best to emphasize this point in a way that reflects the biggest possible number, assuming the number is what's most important to the customer. \n\nCompanies like Netskope and Zscaler count datacenters, which don't always reflect the true global footprint/distribution in a way that resonates with global organizations. Cato counts unique markets they are in versus datacenters. If you're a global organization and care about distribution of coverage, then the market count is probably most important. It doesn't matter as much that you have (5) Datacenters in London and so that adds (5) to your overall PoP count. It matters more, assuming you can support the customer load, that you have presence in London. To that extent, Cato is as distributed (or even more distributed) as Netskope. Zscaler is not so distributed. They have a high datacenter count, but they don't have service symmetry within those Datacenters or markets. This dilutes their count/distribution a bit more.  \n\nSome numbers right off their respective websites:\n\nCato Networks - 87 unique markets (service symmetry)  \nNetskope - 77 unique markets (service symmetry)  \nZscaler - 68 unique markets (service asymmetry, not all markets have all services available for all customers)",

Their solution was/is purpose built to address the real challenges for enterprises that drove SASE to surface, e.g. reducing risk by reducing complexity. If you consider this point, then there really aren't many options out there that compete or come close to Cato. That being said, there are other solutions that do a part of SASE very well, and as good as Cato. Consider Netskope, for example, really strong on the Cloud App Security side of things. This was their focus from the onset and it's clear they are the market leader there. Zscaler really showed strength earlier on with Cloud based internet security. They focused on a world that would be nothing but HTTP/s. They do that part really well. Considering the world is not yet solely HTTP/s, if you're needs extend out to other ports/protocols and use cases, Zscaler has it's shortcomings.\n\nIf your goal is really a strategy that mirrors that of the goals of SASE then Cato really is the leader in the space.

Some will be great some probably not so great.  \n\nYou can inspect private traffic with ZIA+ZPA customers do it all the time for DLP. I would argue that \"disparate\" is optimized. Why have Internet traffic go through a connector vs a separate processing node just focused on that traffic? \n\nIn terms of the charging for burst, there was a time when Palo was indeed charging for that. Perhaps it is different now though I do still see their SLA still states their latency for Prisma excludes scaling events.

When in office, the proxy only applies to traffic going from inside the org to outside. However, when WFH, since the path seems to be ZIA app &gt; cloud &gt; ZPA proxy &gt; org internal, it results some annoyances in our deployment:\n\n  - all DNS queries for internal resources will resolve to a ZPA proxy IP and not their internal IP\n  - ping traffic is tunneled but the proxy drops it\n  - traceroute is not tunneled at all\n \nThese have all been worked around by creating a portal to source them internally.",

It is the only cloud proxy product I've ever used but so far it's been good for us and our workflow. Granted, we don't use it for anything extensive in my opinion, mainly use a PAC file to forward traffic to ZIA for SSL Inspection with a few exceptions here and there where traffic is sent direct. We also have access policies to limit what users can access and what not. We messed around with DLP but it never really went anywhere. We did a POC of the ZCC client and it worked, but did not see any mass rollout since we had no real use as the PAC file is serving us just fine. Must be me just being used to the interface but I find it fairly easy to navigate and don't mind going to different portals since they are launched from the main ZIA interface. Support has been good except for 1 time where they threw their hands up and gave up on our ticket (the issue ended up being on our side and we had no proof it was a ZScaler issue so I cut them some slack there). While it is pricey, it has been a great solution for us and our road warrior user base.",

We need web filtering, using it mostly to try to reduce the likelihood of malware download and code of conduct violations. We've been on ZIA for 6+ years.\n\nWe're using ZIA, Advanced Cloud Firewall, ZPA, ZDX and Cloud Connectors; identity is backed by Entra. We're also set up for DR fallback, in case Zscaler cloud has any issues.\n\nI do think that the level of support your account team provides is significant. For us it's really good, we have frequent syncs, Zscaler really seems to care about our use cases, sometimes adjusting product roadmaps accordingly. We get sessions with people who have deployed the technology in real life, large scale context etc.\n\nThe single portal is a topic that definitely is eagerly awaited. Log searches on the portal aren't great, but we stream logs to our SIEM and searching there is no issue.\n\nA year or two ago we surveyed the market and did some PoCs with competitors. At least one favorably mentioned in other comments we were also very happy with, but as there was no price difference, no killer feature, there was also no incentive to change anything. We'll likely do the same exercise again in a year or two, so let's see.\n\nSo really the answer is what you want out of the solution. The troubleshooting ZDX can provide support can be fantastic; ZPA from a user perspective (aside from masking IPs) just works, and the ability to stick connectors wherever we need them globally close to the end resources is very easy.\n\nIf you're already a shop that is leveraging Palo Alto or Cisco, for example, then those are probably going to be better options. If not, I'd say you have to do a Proof of Concept and really dig into the specific details and use cases. For us it's been a good and reliable solution.",

After 2 min of them trying to figure out why there were no capture files written and them not noticing they forgot to setup the capture stages I hung up and called my account rep. It took another 2 weeks of back and forth and escalations to finally find the issue. Somehow the session ID was getting duplicated with a \"stale\" session ID.

I've actually gone through the effort of excluding popular speedtest websites from the proxy to shut end users up because the standard bandwidth tests just aren't meaningful.\n\nSecond - get ZDX. It's invaluable for troubleshooting with end users.\n\nThird - if you're not running ZT2 w/ dTLS wherever possible, you're losing a ton of performance due to overhead. Migrate users as soon as possible.\n\nFourth - Turn on Flow Control logging - this gives insight into bypassed traffic as well which leads to the next point.\n\nFinally - start analyzing and thinking about what's important for you to actually look at and proxy and what you inherently trust. Even though Zscaler offers the 1-click configuration for M365 - I still exclude most Microsoft endpoints as detailed [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/managing-office-365-endpoints?view=o365-worldwide#use-a-pac-file-for-direct-routing-of-vital-microsoft-365-traffic) since we're not really close to a Zscaler DC. User complaints have drastically dropped since I've done that. Numerous other things that are latency sensitive are also bypassed as well as things that we just inherently trust. Flow logging makes this much less risky because I can still see when they visit the sites - I just can't enforce policy on it - but we'd never enforce policy on those sites anyways.",

But geo does not always mean closest. IIRC, they’ve recently added some latency detection for ZIA, maybe ZPA too? But I have had issues with this.\n\nExample 1: I was in Hawaii and my connections were brutal. Looking at my logs, I found I was being directed to the Mexico City datacenter, but the fiber path (looked this up online) from Hawaii back to the continent goes through Seattle and San Fran. So my path to the internet was HI, to San Fran to Mexico, to my destination. To reach services in my western Canadian DCs, even longer.  Fortunately I have some public Private Service Edges I could bring to bear to fix this. (Ask sales about these, they are also great for DR)\n\nExample 2: the primary ISPs in our area were not peered remotely closely to Zscaler’s ISP, Zayo. So the path from almost all my users hauled through 3 other ISPs and crossed the border twice to reach Zscaler. When there was peering saturation between those transit ISPs, Zscaler couldn’t detect it, but all of my users’ sessions got dropped. \nMy public PSEs were again the solution, I can geolocate them right on top of a problematic Zscaler DC and override it in seconds.\n\nLastly, I would ask about your 10-15% issue. Why do you care? \n1. Don’t most users have 100Mbps-1Gbps internet nowadays? How is 10% of that even noticed? (Ignore this, I see below, your upload drops TO 15%, not BY 15%. Ouch) still, walk the path. Use WinMTR to monitor the path to the DC your users should be connecting to. Watch for high latency.\n2. What are users doing from their EUC devices that they need high upload throughput? If you’re needing high throughput over long, fat links (see bandwidth-delay product) maybe cloud services aren’t for you?\nOr maybe that workload needs to be dealt with differently?",

Zscaler should have been stood up and configured completely, cutover on test groups, and then incrementally throughout the org with users being told not to use AnyConnect once cutover. \n\nI wonder if a PAC configuration in the agent telling it to bypass traffic intercept for your AnyConnect traffic would work for you all?  Or you could setup the agent so that when it detects the AnyConnect adapter is up, it disables ZPA. Though that would require AnyConnect to be properly configured for split tunnel.  \n\nThere are options to fix your issue, most certainly. Will you got 100up/down on Zscaler, no. Should you get closer to 80/80, yes.\n\nOh also, it may benefit to have networking involved if your security team doesn't have any network specialists on it.",

The minute end users turn off zscaler, it spikes way up to the rate speed setting, of course, we need to perform this test via [speedtest.net](http://speedtest.net) or other speed test sites.  From the end user's point view, they DON'T CARE for the difference between throughput and latency, they just want their apps to work fluidly.  And this is the evidence they can see that things are \"slow\".\n\nSo basically we are saying boat load full time zscaler admins looking for ip's/sites to exclude for application access, which our security team mostly have done and the bitchings continue from end users.  Sometimes zscaler functions so spotty that our Cisco anyconnect client also disconnects sporadically.  People joke about getting \"ZSCALED\" all day long and yet we can't see reliability any time soon.  People complain to the network admin and not the security folks because zscaler masks issues as \"connection issues\" but hey, I just run and accommodate the circuits,",

These routers have a small state table that quickly gets filled up with the numerous tunnel connections ZIA and ZPA use so they run into state exhaustion. \n1% of the times it’s the site or application having issues, nothing Zscaler related and ZDX helps with that, leaving about 1% of the time that it’s an actual Zscaler issue that needs a ticket opened. \nUsers also don’t understand that the Speedtest numbers reflects a single connection and Xscaler creates hundreds of unique connections, then I show them proof that 15Mbps is way more than their app needs to pull data or for that file to open from the server.

There’s lots there explaining how things work and how to do those things within their product, but if your customers have to do SO much work to use your product or get things to work properly, that’s bad design. Good design makes things easier and more accessible to the people they’re trying to support. I should’ve done more of my own research on them. Definitely not using them going forward.",

            "body": "*&gt;what your evaluation of VMware technical support?*\n\nOne thing to consider is who's supporting it because there are (and frankly have been for some time) multiple options over who you get support from...\n\n1. OEM support. Dell/HPE others will sell you vOEM (what it's now called) with a server. There's also subset programs of this (VxRAIL, UCP-HC etc) around appliances for some time. again, on the back end they may open escalations.\n2. CSPs (Formerly VCPP, formerly VCAN). The cloud provider handles first levels of support and escalates on the back end to to VMware etc.\n3. Distributor support - (***New***) Certain SKU's (Standard, VVF) get routed here.\n4. Direct support (VCF) - Direct support with VMware. VMConAWS also. This also general includes some assistance with getting stuff setup on VCF and configured which can lower the support needs as VMware is helping make sure it is configured properly.\n5. Hyperscaler support - AVS, Oracle VMware Cloud, IBM Cloud Support, OVH etc.\n6. Other things that can augment support (TAMs, who have their own health check services, SAMs, 3rd party MSPs often added on top of other options) In addition some dark sites will hire a PSO resource who basically acts as a TSE who sits chained to some secret facility hush a boom cluster that can't see the light of day.\n\nVMware itself had all kinds of different support SKUs over the years (Support 360, Production, Basic, Healthcare, Telco, Mission Critical, BCS) that all had different implications.\n\nI would also argue sometimes people REALLY confuse support with PSO. Working for a MSP and watching customers open TAC cases to configure a switch, or add a VLAN made me realize just how extreme this gets. I've also seen customers confuse support for training staff in general in this industry.\n\nAlso how much you engage with support differs hugely from how you use the products. using VCF as intended will cut down a lot of support cases (we estimate 90% based on a study of tickets) Partly though automation of configurations, and using well established patterns. To be fair there are reasons people do different stuff.\n\nDifferent customers in vastly different situations and staffing levels and feature usage are going to see wildly different value in the above solutions.\n\n*Was the answer an acceptable solution?*\n\nActually I can think of a Ticket on a firmware issue,  that I REALLY didn't like the outcome on (to be fair it wasn't VMware's fault really). But I obsessively chased the issue and.. accepted an offer at VMware and eventually got a fix shipped by the guilty party. This raises an issue of sometimes an issue isn't a SR (Support issue, sometimes it's a PR (Bug) and sometimes that bug has 3rd party dependencies. Sometimes it's a FR (Feature request). Sometimes it's a documentation issue (PR with the IX team), Sometimes there needs to be more guidance on how to use the feature (My team's problem). Before you blame support, recognize there's lots of other people who may ultimately may need to \"Own\" that problem outside of the person on the other end of the zoom call.",

Here's a technical problem nobody really mentions during sales or on-boarding but they fucking know exists but is a fatal flaw.\n\nNetskope doesnt support QUIC/HTTP3.... so either you just allow QUIC to bypass (missing the traffic) or block it entirely and never let anyone use QUIC websites (which is becoming a huge portion of the internet). Effectively this partially breaks tones of applications (like anything Google related) and will result in intermittent issues nobody can reproduce reliably. \n\nThink about that... 10 year old protocol and they still haven't added it?\n\nI ripped out Netskope and replaced it after it took 4 months for their people to finally sheepishly admit it doesn't support QUIC AND PROBABLY WONT EVER... Meaning as the internet goes more and HTTP3, netskope issues will go up and there's a tangible finite shelf life of it.\n\nThey also strongly suggest DNS over HTTPS and DNS over TLS to be blocked which is idiocy, DNS over udp is trash, abusable and companies still using it should feel bad.\n\nAlso their customer support services are the worst I've ever seen.

But yes, those are also super annoying.\n\nThey auto block it in most cases but if you have thing mac users then it's not as good at ensuring its blocked properly, very hit or miss meaning sometimes it will up-negotiate to QUIC then die as it fails post negotiation.\n\nBasically what we was was a lot of sessions would work paritally, google docs would work then suddenly not, features within gmail would sometimes die in the middle of using it, etc. Since they dont specifically identify QUIC/HTTP3, it's not possible to ensure all the possible ports (like UDP 8080) are denied meaning it will sometimes still attempt it and then fail.",

If you want the full value of last mile optimizations for Internet bound traffic you have to deploy headends in DCs and backhaul branch traffic there to take advantage of highly resilient pipes in the DC for persisting things like egress NAT, etc.\n\nFor Cato, easy button. Easy to deploy. Easy to manage and no maintenance. Cato takes care of maintenance. Because the other end of the SDWAN bookend is their Cloud, you get things like NAT persistance to internet by default. Last mile optimizations builtin in all directions. If you're a global enterprise with a global footprint you also get the value of their backbone which delivers long haul predictability and traffic acceleration. \n\nI honestly can't think of technical reasons why you would want to do Fortinet over Cato for SDWAN except that if you have Fortigates already...I think it's still free?\n\nAgain this is from the perspective of just considering SDWAN and not other use cases.",

Without Fortigate on the other end you can't control your shaping except for egress. You cannot put a Fortigate in O365. The Cato Cloud sits in between all traffic so that means all last mile optimizations apply WAN and Internet bound.\n\n5) that's an interesting argument. I guess you're anti cloud in general? Don't use SaaS based anything? The Cato Cloud and it's SDWAN edge have been built to be resilient in just about any kind of failure scenario even with a theoretical doomsday situation where their cloud went down completely (the equivalent of AWS, Azure and GCP all going down together, because Catos Cloud is more distributed than even theirs). What that means...? Cato's worst day ever would turn it into the equivalent of...(drum roll) Fortinet SDWAN. \n\n6) CISA, NSA and FBI all warn about how unmaintained and exploitable Fortinet technologies are. I mean...just google \"Fortinet vulnerabilities in the news\". The list is endless, but it's not like other vendors can't have vulnerabilities too. That's not the point. The point is that Fortinet seems to have them somewhat frequently and the burden of effort falls on the enterprises to take care of them. So if I have to choose a DIY maintenance solution (Fortinet) or a solution that is automatically maintained by the supplier (Cato)...seems like it could be an important consideration for an enterprise. \n\nHappy to openly discuss real arguments here if you have any. It does seem like the only thing you know about Cato is that it is a Cloud. Maybe you have more insight for the community?",

But man is it a pain to implement from start to finish.\n\nIf you are already used to FortiGate management, and are accepting of the limitations (which are minor) compared to the SilverPeak gear, then definitely go with Fortinet. Is it as feature rich? No, but does that truly matter for your use case?\n\nThere has been a lot of solid information given by the others who commented before me. The biggest recommendations I can make is decide why you are moving to SD-WAN. Come up with the problems it will solve, define some success criteria, and have the vendors do a POC if possible.\n\nOr just buy the Fortinet solution.",

It’s true, secure authentication that enables ANY IP-based communication to run through an overlay, requiring authentication before connection. This makes the system robust without relying on trust assumptions.\n\nImplementing OpenZiti has been, without a doubt, the best technology decision for my business. Not only does it secure everything by default, but it also simplifies the process of deploying new applications, saving both time and resources.",

The UI is clunky, but after you use it for a month or so, you get used to it.  \n\nThe WLC 9800 UI was so bad (some functions just didn't work at all), so we just did everything via CLI.  ASDM is a hot mess, I hate that with a passion.  Convert that to a HTML5 front end or something.  They came out with something else to replace it, but I can't remember what it is.  Don't get me started on ACS, that thing was a steaming pile that would randomly wipe out your TACACS configs if you didn't have the right browser version.\n\nAt the end of the day, Cisco has never made a great UI.

I use Firefox for most Cisco stuff these days.\n\nCisco’s UI misadventures are an interesting story and i bet a UC student could write an interstellar thesis on how they don’t work. \n\nOverall it’s similar to Cisco and CLI interfaces, but so many networking companies designed their CLI to be ‘Cisco like’ that we think of it as a much of weird IOS dialects. In truth it’s the same story: Cisco buys into a market and their CLIn(and possibly underlying tech) moves to be IOS based, but the GUI evolves much more slowly.\n\nCisco probably should hire a UI team to create a ‘standard’ and start pushing every product to use it, but I’d expect it to end up more like the WLCs where there’s a slightly prettier ’new’ interface that is less useful so you end up clicking the Advanced link to go back to the old one.\n\nI think there’s a lot of inertia concerns, too. For example CallManager seemed to just add new features in at the end of existing menus instead of grouping things together. This is probably to avoid complaints from existing users. CUCM and the voicemail app (which tend to be closely linked in usage) having such different UIs was always a great example of no one caring.",

The problem is things have changed vastly and Cisco has not really adopted a new strategy with next gen devices, they just seem to build on top of whats pre existing, which makes it difficult to program GUIs to map to the CLI commands, which leads to a clunky, crappy experience.\n\nThis is also why Cisco devices now are prone to so many bugs. Fix one part of the code and another part breaks. This is typical in monolithic coding.\n\nFor years I have s said Cisco needs to create a new OS from scratch and apply to all new network devices and eventually cut off the legacy IOS. \n\nUntil they do this they will get outpaced by other network vendors .\n\nEDIT: THis is also why their acquisitions turn to shit after a while. Sourcefire was a great product until cisco turned into firepower. Viptela seems to be going down the same path (no pun)\n\nIf Cisco was smart they would leverage the Meraki brand and do some R&amp;D and create an enterprise-class level of Meraki. If you could get your LAN, WAN, FW, DataCenter in something like Meraki's Single pane of glass and enhance automation, they would be on top of the game. Let the child company take over the parent. Just my two cents.\n\nLook at Microsoft, they had to re do almost everything to make Azure and Office 365 adaptable to this new cloud world we live in. \n\nI digress.

For the past 8-10 months i've been working with Palo Alto, and FortiNet team. We determined Palo Alto was too expensive, and FortiGates were right in budget range, even with the FortiSASE product.\n\nHowever, we have an Aryaka from our main DC to secondary DC via SD-WAN, Fully managed by them. its been a great product and never had issues. Someone from our team introduced Aryaka to our project, and they apparently have full (Subscription based as it seems) Firewall solution.\n\nI know nothing about Aryaka as far as Firewall capabilities go, and i'm wondering if anyone has any experience with their solution.\n\nWe run a SaaS out of our organization through HTTPs, so security is a concern for us, as well as performance. This is why i was leaning toward PA and Forti. We also have around 16 branch offices, that we want interconnected, so Forti was a very strong contender for this with their SDWAN capabilities in their firewalls, with FortiSASE.",

Fortinet's is alright, though I struggle to call it true SASE as it is not a single management plane. You have to manage the FortiGates on their own (or with FortiManager) and then manage FortiSASE separately. (There is some FortiManager capability these days with FortiSASE, but it's limited). Fortinet does not have their own backbone, so it also would have to be layered on top of your Aryaka which can be a little complicated. Though you are already doing this today so no big deal. \n\nAryaka is a good path to explore. They are a SASE provider and have the network backbone that it sounds like you are currently utilizing. This would bring your remote connectivity, firewalls, and SDWAN all into a single solution. My customers who do this love it. My only caution with Aryaka is that they grew up in the Network-as-a-Service/SDWAN space like you are currently utilizing. Their SASE and FWaaS is pretty immature and my customers who review it find it lacking features, especially if you are moving from a tradition solution like SonicWALL. \n\nIn addition to Aryaka, I would recommend you explore Cato Networks too. They are the leader in the SASE space and have a mature FWaaS that can replace on prem firewalls and brings the SSE component of remote users into a single platform. They also have the network piece, so if you find the solution meets your needs you could consolidate that network/SDWAN piece in to them as well. My customers tend to find Cato is a much more complete solution and tend to go this way. \n\nBest of luck on your search!",

They also have a completely unified single-pass security stack in their PoPs. Not many suppliers can tout \"single-pass\" anymore. With disaggregated services (on-prem, in cloud, etc.) they just can't offer single-pass and can't share context for optimal efficacy. With Cato, you can self-manage or get a fully managed solution. Even if you can't replace Aryaka between your primary &amp; secondary DC's (today), you can still deploy Cato (coexist) and extend the same kind of end-to-end optimization with Edge/Branch SD-WAN + backbone to your DC's and to the Internet for all your sites with full inline security inspection. Also unique, you get SD-WAN/last mile optimization to both WAN &amp; Internet/SaaS resources. This is something you can get through Ayraka as well, because they have a similar cloud architecture to Cato, but this is not something you will get with FortiSASE. \n\nWhat's available today on the truck with Cato is the following:  \nGlobal Network with 99.999 SLA  \nEdge SD-WAN  \nFWaaS  \nUniversal ZTNA  \nSWG  \nIPS  \nNGAM  \nCASB  \nDLP  \nEPP/EDR  \nXDR  \nDEM  \nand IoT/OT Security.\n\nPick and choose what you need. As your needs change, onboarding new services is a flip a switch and defining a policy (same UI). All the context of everything you integrated (IDP) in the solution thus far is available to any new service you enable, e.g. single shared context (which is unique to Cato). The solution is completely converged in a single codebase and has single UI. Being a cloud-native, there's no more DIY patching. Supplier maintains the platform 100%. It's easy and sophisticated.\n\nIf Cato isn't in the cards for consideration, then I would say consolidating on Aryaka feels more like a step forward. Going with Fortinet is a step backward, IMO.",

This was a perfect answer to our question.

Meraki is easy, but also very rudimentary in many ways when it comes to network management and network policies.

Not a big fish, but big enough to spend a few thousand $ per month and have a dedicated customer success rep.  I'm pretty disappointed in the new team that was assigned to me, and I wonder if it's a widespread issue, or just the luck of the draw.\n\nRecently, a lot has changed at Cloudflare:\n\n  - They reorganized things to downgrade their baseline enterprise support, and make you pay for the \"premium\" level that used to be the baseline.  That's fine- I don't need that much support.  And I was honestly surprised at how much handholding they gave me before.\n  - The Customer Success team turned over a few times before I could even meet them.  Again, that's fine, and understandable if Cloudflare is shaking things up.\n\nI was finally able to to meet the new Customer Success rep for a quarterly review.  I was pretty bummed at the interaction.\n\n  - She did not understand my (pretty basic) environment.  Even after explaining it several times.\n  - She used stats dishonestly to make it seem like I need to buy new services.  This includes using FUD while looking at a graph of automated traffic, which is already being handled by custom rules.\n  - She kept mentioning how unusual our situation is.  \"You seem to get a DDoS attack every 6 months or so.  That's really serious\".  (They're 5 minute attacks - clearly the free samples from low quality DDoSer services, and they don't impact our service.)\n  - When I mentioned some cost-saving changes that are coming up, she replied with \"Good, we can roll that over into new Cloudflare services\"\n\nMy last Cloudflare team knew _everything_ about Cloudflare, and could even warn me about quirks, inaccuracies, and features that were still half-baked on the back end.  This new team glosses over those and tries to sell, sell, sell.   They treat me more like a clueless CEO than a technical professional.\n\nDoes this seem like a systemic issue at Cloudflare?  Or just an isolated bad team?",

Nothing about what it is, or what it does.\n\nSo then you Google something like “Zscaler Autofabulation”, and get a link to the release notes that will say something like “added Autofabulation”, or even worse “fix for Autofabulation”, with no info on what was broken.\n\nZscaler if you are out there, you have 12,000 features, but provide next to zero information on what any of them do, why they exist, recommended defaults and use cases. The leading practices guides are good, but they provide no info on new features.\n\nHonestly I think it’s all a ploy to sell TAM time and training credits.

The inability to reach a local network has caused us to cancel classes as well as on-site resident engineers to effectively be useless for local tech support. Again, IT’s is “aww, so sad”.

Fortinet sell security products. For the implementation you need Partners with the knowledge about the products and the understanding of your business. Only with that combination any complex IT system will be a success on long term.\n\nWe are a Fortinet Partner and if we need help for new technology (e.g. ZTNA) our partner manager can link us to the right person internally on Fortinet. From my point of view the knowledge sharing and support for partners are on a good level.\n\nAnd at the end: Do a PoC before you implement any new technology.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope you will find the right partner for you soon and have fun and success with fortinet products again.",

It has to do with both your physical location geographically, along with how you align into their “sectors”. For instance a state or province or region, will have several account teams — a Public Sector Government, a Public Education K-12, a Higher Education, a Major Accounts with annual revenue of over $XX, a Named Account Team which generally are SMBs over XX size, and an Inside Account Team who deal with the smaller clients. \n\nTo put things in perspective — a Major Accounts Team might deal with your local Utilities, maybe the Auto Insurance companies in your area, a retail company with 300 stores, and restaurant chains with over 100 locations… and they’ll have about 200 customers like that. \n\nA Named Account Manager will only have 300-500 clients. Inside rep? Over 1000.  An average work year has about 245 working days. Which their vacation time comes out of, so 230 working days. So the Account Team at Fortinet really does count on the Fortinet Partners to multiply their hours by handling most of the things like this for them. They have to! They only have maybe an hour a year for each client, when you take all their quarterly briefing meetings, travel time, internal training, and marketing event hours away out of those 230 working days.",

The PS team is really good and TAC can support you after that. Your account guy can get you a set up with a FastTrack that will go though implementing ZTNA for free if needed.  The only company that would provide tech assistance in setting up a product that I have found was Enterasys Networks - now own by Extreme Networks.  \n\n\nFor pricing, EVERYONE is raising their prices. Fortinet, Cisco, Palo, Juniper etc... are all trying to buy the same chips, and the shortage has caused prices to skyrocket. I haven't seen this many price increases ever! But it has more to do with the rising cost of everything from shipping to raw materials.   \n\n\nIn terms of getting a new account manager, I don't think that is gong to happen, unless your AM has already transitioned to another role and hasn't let you know. I would sign up for one of those \"put your info here for a demo\". Those messages will go to an internal team and they will have your account manager reach out. This will at least let you know if your AM is still your AM, or if you have a new AM.  \n\n\nIn terms of TAC - I think I have had this issue with every vendor I have ever used. Sometimes you're very luck and get a tenured TAC guy, sometimes you get the n00b. If you need something worked on sooner rather than later, I would contact TAC via phone.

Examples are:\r  \n◼ Catastrophic impact to mission-critical functionality\r  \n◼ An outage impacting multiple active user sessions and/or critical traffic\r  \n◼ A major loss of connectivity\r  \n◼ A vital security flaw impacting active business services\r  \nThe customer and Fortinet both commit to dedicate technical resources 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year by telephone and remote sessions.\r  \nIf a workaround is accepted, a Priority 1 ticket will be reclassified in priority. Workarounds may include:\r  \n◼ Reverting configuration changes\r  \n◼ A firmware upgrade or downgrade\r  \n◼ Replacement of the hardware\r  \n◼ A change to the configuration\r  \n\n\nPriority 2\r  \nA technical ticket created for an issue that causes significant impact to mission-critical functionality in a live or production network environment. Examples are:\r  \n◼ Serious loss or frequent instabilities of mission-critical functionality impacting active user sessions\r  \n◼ Loss of redundancy of a critical component impacting live business services\r  \nThe customer and Fortinet commit to dedicate technical resources 8 hours a day, 7 days a week for Priority 2 tickets. If a workaround is accepted by the customer, a Priority 2 ticket will be reclassified in priority.\r  \n\n\nPriority 3\r  \nAny technical ticket created for an issue in the customer network that has minimal impact to business operations. An example is occasional or intermittent instabilities of core functions.\r  \nA Priority 3 ticket may also cover any outstanding troubleshooting or investigation for a Priority 1 or Priority 2 incident for which a workaround has been accepted.\r  \nFortinet and the customer will assign resources 8x5 during business days until a resolution or workaround has been provided.\r  \n\n\nPriority 4\r  \nAny technical ticket created for additional information, including basic configuration assistance, errors in documentation, or minor defects that do not impact business services.\r  \nFortinet and the customer will assign resources 8x5 during business days until a resolution or workaround has been provided.",

Notably pointed out that on pages were Zaraz was not working calls to zaraz.debug() were not working, and indeed Zaraz did not seem to be loading at all.\n2. Several days later, we get a reply that their support team is delayed due to high volume. We should search for our issue in the community and reply back if we still need help.\n3. Within an hour we replied back that yes, we still need help. We already searched for the issue, found one case on the community forums, and there was never any response to it.\n4. A week goes by; we ask for an update. No reply.\n5. Two weeks go by; we ask for an update. No reply.\n6. A month goes by; a reply comes in! The reply? \"Did you try using zaraz.debug()?\"\n\nA month after our last ping, 1.5 months since our original ticket. That is the reply. Something literally mentioned in detail in the actual support ticket. Yikes.\n\nAnyway, we moved on from Zaraz. Seems like a neat product, but we could not get it working. The level of support from a service we have paid many thousands of dollars for over the last couple years has me scratching my head. Is this just a bad example? Is Zaraz maybe not something they care about?\n\nHalf rant / half curious if CloudFlare support is really this bad.",

I have been programming since 1976, had a DARPA-net account at Tektronix in the mid-1970's when there were approx 100 mainframe nodes in total.  I have over the decades experienced all manner of tech support, most pretty darn good really and I say again with confidence, Cloudflare is in it's own class of horrible.\n\nCloudflare's stock has been sinking for weeks.  I should suggest to our wealth management company they short Cloudflare stock.\n\nFor regular hosting and registrar customers you can not get a human chat, ever.  The Cloudflare Community Forum is laughable.  If they classify you as a \"new user\" any questions you ask on the forum are closed when 3 responses are logged.  In my most recent case.  I asked a question regarding pointing DNS servers to my hosting company for a domain registered with Cloudflare.  Responses 1 &amp; 2 were singularly unhelpful.  Response #3 was helpful, but I needed to ask a brief clarifying question .... which was NOT allowed by the forum system software because my thread already had a total of four links.   Insane.\n\nMoving my domains out of Cloudflare.  Any money saved using Cloudflare is immaterial if questions go unanswered.  My own fault for not having done better due-diligence regarding their tech support.  Reviews of Cloudflare products were good, but awful support negates that quickly since no software can be expected to be perfect.  Hope Cloudflare stock goes to zero and their developers move on to more satisfying jobs.",

Bandwidth may be cheap at one provider, but DDoS attacks will cost you.  \n- Friction is high to switch, especially if you're a SaaS provider with a customer-controlled DNS model.  Getting all your customers to change an IP or DNS setting is nontrivial.  And even most enterprises don't own their IPs at Cloudflare.\n\nIn reality, we know how this market works.  They pay their bills, and then they make up prices that will make them the most money possible.  They will try to say the prices are related to some underlying reason, but it's obvious that there are so many layers of abstraction within the CDN business, that any of their costs have no effect on any particular end product.",

But then paying experienced folks that actually know your products and can support them costs as much as a low to mid level software engineer and puts you right in the layoffs/outsourcing crosshairs.\n\nBut then it’s still ass anyways because support is… well… support: managers breathing down your neck for some dumb KPI where you get more credit for asking “are you still having this issue”? Then proceed to abandoning you instead of actually taking the time to solve it because that’s what gets them a good review and bonus.\n\nI would have loved to spend my career in support… just do my 40 and leave for some decent pay, but it’s a bad deal if you’re in U.S. constantly feeling like you’ll be laid off any day",

But since they’re not in the habit of turning customer tickets away, it creates a huge backlog that would need a literal army to handle. \n\nEnter Partner-Enabled Support.  \nASC partners have a much smaller customer base and are better suited to be able to handle the respective ticket load. As a bonus, they are more inclined to get to know your infrastructure over time, making troubleshooting faster and more effective. \n\nCost-wise, you’re usually paying the same or less but getting far better service. \n\nThere’s a misconception that calling the vendor directly means you’ll get better engineers and support but this simply isn’t true.",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nAs the title suggests I have shortlisted a couple of SASE vendors for our company and will go through why.\n\nOur requirements are the following:\n\nCoffee shop scenario where we protect remote users wherever they are and connect to private resources whether SaaS or Public Cloud. We are serverless meaning no servers or dependancy on any of our physical sites, everything needed is in public cloud or SaaS. 800+ users, multi-OS environment, predominately EU based.\n\nOnly 5-6 managed sites with the idea would be eventually SD-WAN (we have no MPLS just DIA with Tier 1 ISPs) if not implemented already (We have some sites for Fortigate SD-WAN), for now the simple use case is protecting our user's managed devices and eventually moving to IoT and what not. So you could say our priority is SSE with scope to introduce SD-WAN.\n\nPOVs conducted based on an initial exposure to Gartner MQ and other review blogs -\n\nFortiSASE - We have some FortiGates and introducing more so it seemed the natural next step to see if we can adopt it but had loads of issues with 3rd party integrations and performance.  \nNetskope - Great product like CASB &amp; DLP but quite expensive  \nCato - Very simple to understand and use, best UI experience and can see easiest to deploy but the whole 3-5 minute deployments to all POPs kind of annoys me.  \nZscaler - Great product very feature rich with quick policy deployments but very enterprise focuses and clunky dashboard with multiple panes of glass resulting in steeper learning curve (Of course the new experience centre is yet to be seen)\n\nI have narrowed it down to CATO &amp; ZScaler based on our needs but wanted to user's opinions on anyone that has done a POV or deployed it. Would greatly appreciate if anyone can let me know of anything they have experienced/kinks seen and why they went for either vendor.\n\nFeel free to bring in your support experience, purchasing experience and anything else in the process.",

We ran a load of reports out of the Palo to identify traffic flows, and then built up new rules in Cato to match. \nWe then slowly migrated groups of users to route out of Cato, and added any rules we missed when users reported issues. Once we had everyone on Cato we enabled TLS inspection gradually by website category.\nOverall I’d say it was very smooth, and Cato support were great when we had questions.",

That's evidenced by the fleet of engineers required by them to implement the solution and how much professional services they dump on new deployments.\n\nTheir leadership in the MQ is the byproduct of having a lot of products that check all the boxes and having a massive existing customer base that they are \"platformizing\" (e.g. converting over to new commercial packaging vs. actually offering a technical value or advantage).\n\nPANW has great technologies.

Zscaler offers a MSP console for customers managing other customers - so you can quickly switch between organisations etc. The effort is onboarding a customer rather than operating it in my opinion - you need to setup authentication, traffic forwarding, policies. Don’t get me wrong - it can be completed in a couple of hours and scripted a lot, but it’s still an effort to onboard. Each customer will have their own needs and particularities which take time to be built in the initial policies.",

A prime example of this is in the Client Connector Dashboard, looking at your registered users/devices and doing an export.  Highlight all the duplicates in the host name column in Excel, discarding all of the \"removed\" licenses, and if you have around 1500 end users you're probably looking at around 2000 consumed licenses.  This is because you have admins logging into end user devices to troubleshoot anything, it consumes another license.  But why, you ask?  Because ZScaler has been losing customers and their sales teams have been aggressively pushing customers to buy more licenses.  If you open a case with ZScaler support, you can have them set the automatic removal of a license if it goes unused after 7 days instead of the default 120 days!  This means after 7 days those admin accounts will be successfully removed from the consumed license pool.  I dropped around 400 licenses immediately after having support implement this, and the sales guy suddenly stopped hounding us for a \"true-up\" of almost 500 additional licenses.\n\nThis sales push needs to stop, and ZScaler needs to start recording license usage by host instead of by allowing multiple users to consume licenses on the same host name.  It's unethical, it's pushy sales tactics and it absolutely needs to stop.  I had a friend recently quit as a sales engineer over at ZScaler because of this particular push.  He saw how unethical it was, but management over there at ZScaler does not give a single crap about screwing their customers, and it's only about the numbers for them.  \n\nI have recently completed a POC of NetSkope, and to be honest I think I will switch my user base over to this platform in the next 12 months.",

We have opted to go with Zscaler for a few reasons.\n\nNetskope had stronger DLP and CASB features, but we had some worries around newness in some key areas that was important to our organisation and how many features they are trying to build up into a short amount of time. Their newedge architecture was really impressive, but we found it difficult to find large customers who were full stack SASE to give reference in our sector to calm any executive worries. Great platform and roadmap ahead though.\n\nPalo seemed a little weaker in DLP and had a reliance on cloud providers for hosting the platform, which we worried about as a tertiary sub-contract with downstream. We also wanted to have a proxy based ZTNA solution to hide client IP addresses to backend services, which Prisma only offered on limited ports. Great firewall capability (as you would expect). \n\nWe opted for Zscaler as they offered a good set of reference customers that showed they had experience in delivering network change and their recent improvements in data protection capabilities. We found their ZTNA had a huge amount of options and integrated into the proxy side more than the others. Quite a big driver was the documentation and training available on the platform as we in-house more functions.",

Netskope and Zscaler don't have that capability. That said, there might be other ways to address the same use case, e.g. securing cloud apps for BOYD. Both Zscaler and Netskope have good coverage there with Netskope probably leading the way through SaaS API-based Security (OOB CASB).\n\nIn the context of the other 2 use cases, e.g. web filtering and ZTNA, all 3 can perform, but only Palo has comprehensive security inspection for its \"ZTNA\" solution. Both Zscaler and Netskope still require you to retain Firewalls that sit between their private access / ZTNA solution and the private resources users are trying to access if you want Advanced Threat Protection to address risks associated with lateral movement on the WAN.\n\nNetskope and Zscaler have a more distributed cloud network than Palo does. Palo compute resides only where GCP/AWS resides. From a market distribution standpoint, they fall short of Netskope and Zscaler. Palo is also beholden to whatever the hyperscalers dictate as costs, scale and growth. That might have a greater impact down the line. I've heard many enterprises speak about performance issues with Zscaler and Palo. Netskope seems to have addressed the SaaS Performance issues better.\n\nI saw someone mention Cato Networks. Cato's strengths are taking the inspection capabilities of Palo and the global cloud network distribution of Netskope/Zscaler and delivering it to the end customer as much more \"easy to use\" solution. There are many other benefits related to performance and network convergence. Still, as it relates to the enterprise browser use case, Cato is in the same bucket as Zscaler &amp; Netskope. To address that use case, you'd would be looking again at their OOB CASB / SaaS API Security for BYOD scenarios.",

Also, inspection in my book is more than just port/protocol access controls. From what I understand, and what seems to be publicly documented by Zscaler, there is no IPS applicability to traffic that is not HTTP/S, FTP or DNS (maybe a few others?). That leaves a pretty big hole as WAN traffic is more than just those few protocols/applications. That's why an inline proxy architecture is far superior than a reverse/forward proxy architecture when it comes to comprehensive security inspection. Again, Zscaler doesn't have comprehensive security inspection even when you \"chain\" services together to try and get better inspection for your Private Access (WAN) needs. Hence, you still need that traditional firewall in your datacenter in between users and workloads.\n\nThe enterprise browser space is driven by BYOD use cases that won't allow for an endpoint agent focused approach.",

We're paying a premium for enterprise plan(USD 250 per TB for CDN and some other features - premium success not included), but the support experience is far from it:\n\n* **Slow Responses:** Even for critical issues, it feels like we’re stuck waiting forever. The \"Enterprise priority\" is barely noticeable.\n* **Pushy AE:** Our account exec only seems interested in milking as much money as possible during renewals. When looped in important support issues, there is usually no response. They take customers for granted knowing well it's difficult to move to another vendor.\n* **Low ROI:** For the price, I expected way better service and attention. Instead, it’s generic responses usually no resolution at all. Even the price feels like a big rip off.\n\nIs this just our bad luck, or is it a pattern others have noticed? How are you dealing with it? Any tips on getting better support from them?\n\n  \nLooks like it's time we start looking for other providers.\n\nWould love to hear your experiences!",

You mention Cato has no in-house security solutions. I'm assuming you mean they don't have anything that they have developed directly as it relates to the services they offer.

If you want the full value of last mile optimizations for Internet bound traffic you have to deploy headends in DCs and backhaul branch traffic there to take advantage of highly resilient pipes in the DC for persisting things like egress NAT, etc.\n\nFor Cato, easy button. Easy to deploy. Easy to manage and no maintenance. Cato takes care of maintenance. Because the other end of the SDWAN bookend is their Cloud, you get things like NAT persistance to internet by default. Last mile optimizations builtin in all directions. If you're a global enterprise with a global footprint you also get the value of their backbone which delivers long haul predictability and traffic acceleration. \n\nI honestly can't think of technical reasons why you would want to do Fortinet over Cato for SDWAN except that if you have Fortigates already...I think it's still free?\n\nAgain this is from the perspective of just considering SDWAN and not other use cases.",

Without Fortigate on the other end you can't control your shaping except for egress. You cannot put a Fortigate in O365. The Cato Cloud sits in between all traffic so that means all last mile optimizations apply WAN and Internet bound.\n\n5) that's an interesting argument. I guess you're anti cloud in general? Don't use SaaS based anything? The Cato Cloud and it's SDWAN edge have been built to be resilient in just about any kind of failure scenario even with a theoretical doomsday situation where their cloud went down completely (the equivalent of AWS, Azure and GCP all going down together, because Catos Cloud is more distributed than even theirs). What that means...? Cato's worst day ever would turn it into the equivalent of...(drum roll) Fortinet SDWAN. \n\n6) CISA, NSA and FBI all warn about how unmaintained and exploitable Fortinet technologies are. I mean...just google \"Fortinet vulnerabilities in the news\". The list is endless, but it's not like other vendors can't have vulnerabilities too. That's not the point. The point is that Fortinet seems to have them somewhat frequently and the burden of effort falls on the enterprises to take care of them. So if I have to choose a DIY maintenance solution (Fortinet) or a solution that is automatically maintained by the supplier (Cato)...seems like it could be an important consideration for an enterprise. \n\nHappy to openly discuss real arguments here if you have any. It does seem like the only thing you know about Cato is that it is a Cloud. Maybe you have more insight for the community?",

Their newedge architecture was really impressive, but we found it difficult to find large customers who were full stack SASE to give reference in our sector to calm any executive worries. Great platform and roadmap ahead though.\n\nPalo seemed a little weaker in DLP and had a reliance on cloud providers for hosting the platform, which we worried about as a tertiary sub-contract with downstream. We also wanted to have a proxy based ZTNA solution to hide client IP addresses to backend services, which Prisma only offered on limited ports. Great firewall capability (as you would expect). \n\nWe opted for Zscaler as they offered a good set of reference customers that showed they had experience in delivering network change and their recent improvements in data protection capabilities. We found their ZTNA had a huge amount of options and integrated into the proxy side more than the others. Quite a big driver was the documentation and training available on the platform as we in-house more functions.",

            "body": "Considering your use cases, only one of the 3 options even addresses the \"private enterprise browser\" requirement. Palo acquired Talon and so acquired that capability. Netskope and Zscaler don't have that capability. That said, there might be other ways to address the same use case, e.g. securing cloud apps for BOYD. Both Zscaler and Netskope have good coverage there with Netskope probably leading the way through SaaS API-based Security (OOB CASB).\n\nIn the context of the other 2 use cases, e.g. web filtering and ZTNA, all 3 can perform, but only Palo has comprehensive security inspection for its \"ZTNA\" solution. Both Zscaler and Netskope still require you to retain Firewalls that sit between their private access / ZTNA solution and the private resources users are trying to access if you want Advanced Threat Protection to address risks associated with lateral movement on the WAN.\n\nNetskope and Zscaler have a more distributed cloud network than Palo does. Palo compute resides only where GCP/AWS resides. From a market distribution standpoint, they fall short of Netskope and Zscaler. Palo is also beholden to whatever the hyperscalers dictate as costs, scale and growth. That might have a greater impact down the line. I've heard many enterprises speak about performance issues with Zscaler and Palo. Netskope seems to have addressed the SaaS Performance issues better.\n\nI saw someone mention Cato Networks. Cato's strengths are taking the inspection capabilities of Palo and the global cloud network distribution of Netskope/Zscaler and delivering it to the end customer as much more \"easy to use\" solution. There are many other benefits related to performance and network convergence. Still, as it relates to the enterprise browser use case, Cato is in the same bucket as Zscaler &amp; Netskope. To address that use case, you'd would be looking again at their OOB CASB / SaaS API Security for BYOD scenarios.",

Island is an independent solution in this space. Zscaler is partnering with Google Chrome Enterprise rather than developing its own Chromium private enterprise browser.",

Also, inspection in my book is more than just port/protocol access controls. From what I understand, and what seems to be publicly documented by Zscaler, there is no IPS applicability to traffic that is not HTTP/S, FTP or DNS (maybe a few others?). That leaves a pretty big hole as WAN traffic is more than just those few protocols/applications. That's why an inline proxy architecture is far superior than a reverse/forward proxy architecture when it comes to comprehensive security inspection. Again, Zscaler doesn't have comprehensive security inspection even when you \"chain\" services together to try and get better inspection for your Private Access (WAN) needs. Hence, you still need that traditional firewall in your datacenter in between users and workloads.\n\nThe enterprise browser space is driven by BYOD use cases that won't allow for an endpoint agent focused approach.",

You will see almost all the ITM features you will see in a firewall will be available here.\n\nWhile you can do certificate header inspection only, since Forti client is managing the endpoint certificate headache you can easily enable SSL DPI, I would suggest go ahead and use it with proper exemptions.\n\nEMS instance used to manage Forti clients is a very light version, and it’s more than enough to fulfill most of the requirements for a SMB or medium customer. Learn it’s limitations and you can plan it for a large scale customer as to how you’re going to deploy it\n\nZTNA tag assignment based on the posture of the end device must designed properly as you will use this to give access to private resources hosted behind a fortigate or For Secure internet access through SASE (not mandatory). \n\nFortinet recommends using SAML authentication for SWG users, while other authentication mechanisms such as LDAP, Local and Radius supported. All of the above is supported for Agent based solution authentication as well.\n\nPer user bandwidth is by default 1.5mb, and based on the number of users provisioned to your account total bandwidth will be allocated. If needed additional bandwidth of 25Mbps chunks can be purchased. A dedicated set of public IP’s can be purchased so when the users access Internet resources Forti SASE will not using these public IP’s. If any other party wants to implement IP based restrictions this can help as you can provide them with your set of public IPs.\n\nPrivate access with ZTNA requires FortiGate knowledge as ZTNA servers and ZTNA policies needs to be configured in the on-premises or cloud hosted FortiGate you own. Pls keep in mind that SASE instance and all the FortiGate must register under the same FortiCloud account, so EMS can be integrated to share the client posture status (ZTNA tag)\n\nPrivate Access with SDWAN requires working knowledge on ADVPN+BGP. While it is easy to configure for proper security I prefer to have controlled route advertisements, SDWAN zones, SLA’s configured for optimal failover. There are some private IP ranges which Fortinet uses within SASE, so make sure that you don’t have the same subnets within your network.\n\nCASB is where I am very weak, but with regards to in-line casb it is fairly easy as you only have to configure the headers to restrict access to a certain tenant in a cloud service provider.\n\nUser onboarding can be a pain when it comes to MAC, but if users are provided with a managed MAC, this should be fairly easy. Mobile devices such as iPhone and android doesn’t support ZTNA private access, but you can make them full tunnel and make the ZTNA tags within Firewall policies.",

(Starts at 50 users, and extra expensive license for dedicated IP's).\n* SPA is only to other fortigates, you can't just deploy a custom IPSEC vpn tunnel.\n* You can't allow forticlient users to add extra VPN tunnels. This feature exists in FortiEMS and should be added in SASE as well. I can't even use my own SASE as I need other tunnels to customers as well. I heard they'll add the feature in the near future.\n\nI've lost a few potential SASE customers because of these limitations. It's a nice product but still has some work.",

        "selftext": "I just saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1in3851/hi_guys_what_is_your_opinion_and_experience_of_a/) and read there (as well as in other places on the internet) that people are not fond of Check Point gateways. I don't have experience with other brands and only work with Check Point so I don't have a good understanding about the differences between brands. So I decided to ask.\n\nWhat does Check Point do better and how does it keep its position in the market despite not liked by some? Is it the extensive customizability, or protection surface, or anything else? I'm well aware that it has a solid environment (not without its own problems though, but nothing is perfect in this universe), but still don't have a good understanding of what makes it stand out and hold on its position in the market.",

            "body": "You need to be careful with those posts. Many people never touched cp or 10y ago and they still say bad things just because they are fan boys of something else. \n\nFor me Check Point is about security. This isn’t just marketing but they catch a lot of stuff than other cannot. SmartConsole is so clean to use on the day to day, the logs search is really good. And so on. CP has as well other really good products such as Email. And I was at CPX, and they continue to improve. \n\nFor sure we will have some bugs, sometimes we will be pissed off by TAC, or we will need to touch files in Expert to resolve an issue. But this will happens with any vendor. \n\n\nCheck Point is not dead and I think they were in a too good position during so many years that competition went and took market shares. But if you check their profits, they actually do a lot of money. Let’s see how the new CEO will change things. \n\n\nI think Palo is starting to be the same as CP 10y ago. They are arrogant and they think they are the best. And now they faced bugs, people doesn’t know in which release to upgrade, and I won’t talk about CVE because this can happen to everyone but yeah at the end I feel much more comfortable with Check Point and specifically by adopting their ecosystem with Gw, Email, SASE and XDR/playblocks",

Less innovation means less exposure to CVE. But make no mistake, they are milking the same old cows for more and more milk. \n\nAdd to this the fact that they are abandoning things like CNAPP (new CEO tightening up) highlights their failure to evolve. They will continue to milk those cows until they shut their doors, because the industries they are successful in are not exactly “bleeding edge”. All they can do is renew, renew, renew. \n\nI say if it works for you, awesome.

It constantly freezes up.  \n\nTAC is often less than helpful.  We brought to their attention that our cloud portal said it was going to expire in 15 days when we were 7 months into our 3 year agreement.  They told us not to worry that there was a 6 grace period, and they'll figure out what's going on.  15 days came, and all our vpn tunnels dropped.  This caused a level 1 outage, and it took them 6 hours to get an engineer that could start looking at it.  That lost us a projected 120k in sales.  2 weeks later, the certs for the ipsec vpn tunnels, which are supposed to auto renew with the online portal, didn't renew.  It took them another 4 hours to figure that out, and another projected 60k in lost revenue.\n\nWhen we push config, we have to do continuous pings to our private cloud because sometimes the tunnels just drop on a config push.  Only the tunnels between checkpoints behave this way.  We've had this issue from the beginning, and they said they would review our confi LG and fly out a SME to let us know where to improve it.  Well, they flew him out, and he arrived with our checkpoint sales team.  They said our config looks fine and let's use the next hour to talk about our playblocks feature.  Thanks for the useless information.  Just today, after 1.5 years, has TAC offered a solution.\n\nStupid things like traffic not going across a vpn even though I built a rule for that traffic.  Only once I built a deny rule and then disable that deny rule did traffic hit the original rule.",

TAC cannot help and we need to revert. Then we need to wait that the problem is fix on another release but we have another problem in our release. wtf should we do?? TAC was good a the beginning but it has decrease heavily the quality and its like they have outsourced TAC 😆\n\n\nPanorama is stuck in 2010, too much information at everyplace and come on . Logs search is horrible 😆 \n\n\nHow can you sell service connection Prisma Access 5k$ and then come at renewal and increase more than 10x the price. How fair it is ? Every time at renewals it’s the same story, price increase , difficult negotiations. \n\nWe got a bug with our bgp in datacenter that killed all connectivity. We had to upgrade to a release and guess what ? No more issue with bgp but now issues with telemetry, and issues on the 100GB network interface. Need to upgrade again ?? \n\n\nWell at the end we all have our own experience. Just sad to bash others.",

It needs extra licenses for every small feature. The UI looks very oldschool in many parts, making it hard to find some of the options if you come from other products. And what sucks most is the mix of many different software options that developed over the years. One thing you can configure by Smart Console, others only by web etc. One Management tool for everything is missing. Same goes for the VPN Client, there are like what 3 or 4 options? All with different licensing and features, the protocols used are properitary and the ui also looks old fashioned and doesn't scale to higher screen resolutions at all. Making mobile clients able to connect via VPN need completely separate configuration...\n\nOverall they are solid tho and for the bigger scale I don't really know better options. For smaller scale Sophos has the better usability and more modern look in my optionen. And for everything possible I'd ofc prefer open source (openSense) stuff, but that's on a whole other scale.",

We just saw it with Crowdstrike but I see it daily with PAN, Citrix and other vendors. I understand that every feature increases the complexity but in an enterprise environment I need stability and availability so the business can work.\nIn another thread someone in regards to the Crowdstrike said, it would be an up selling opportunity for PAN. But I experience so many bugs in Pan-os and Global protect that I am just jumping from bug to bug and version to version. Currently at state that there seems to be no reliable version available.\n\nI'm interested in your thoughts and if there is a way to get PAN to put more focus on stability rather than new features.\n\nMaybe starting a petition? :)\n\nCheers",

I wish they would take a 6-month break from new features and spend that time fixing bugs. \n\nThe problem is that it’s the same all over. Pick a firewall / security vendor. The story is the same. \n\nFor us users, here is my painfully learned advice:\n* Let new code versions age 9-12 months (x.x.7 or so) before putting code into production. You will do slightly less QA for PAN this way. \n* Stay away from code releases with 2-year support cycles unless you have no option. You don’t get much runtime before the code goes EOL.\n* Wait for code releases to go Preferred before using.\n* Test in one site first for a week or two before rolling out everywhere. Doesn’t catch everything, but it helps.\n* New hardware always comes with brand new software. Wait at least 6 months after release to buy and another 3-6 months for testing. \n* And be prepared to ignore all of this when major CVEs get fixed.",

From our side we have increasing number of opened tickets with unresolved bugs and Fortinet don't care about it!\n\nForti support care only for thier KPI for email responses and that's all. Their last favourite answers are: we forwarded to Devs and let you know when respond!  But that not happen - today I found half year waiting for response from Devs to support! I don't think they have any SLA at all!! \n\nFortinet owners care only about release every year new major version regardless of bugs and useless of their software. And you have to pay for useless support which care only for email replies to you and forwarding do Devs blackhole.\n\nSo I'm asking how many problems you have live? Currently we have 16 tickets with pending bug fix over different products. Oldest was opened in 12/2020 and till now they cannot find problem cause why Fortinet SECURITY software didn't work as expected!!!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthanks for responses",

            "body": "Speaking as a former TSE here - I don’t disagree that there are probably issues currently, but I think it’s worth mentioning that many customers who opened tickets didn't always understand how to get good support.  They’d open a ticket with no details or logs then say “call me now” for a Sev3.  Uh no, you're not that special.  Or a Sev1 gets open for a simple question about where to download an ISO for their upgrade later that evening.  Again, no.. not a true production down scenario.   Understanding what level of support they had, what the policies and surrounding SLAs were and even as simple as understanding timezones seemed to be challenging for some.\n\nThen on to the ticket - we’d ask scoping questions, the customer would answer 1-2 of them and ignore the rest.  Or they'd say they performed the requested steps only to find out they didn't and then we'd have to spend time backtracking on the issue.  It just took time to truly scope an issue, get logs and review and troubleshoot.  We were engineers good at troubleshooting, not magicians.  And that's not to mention all those times the cases were opened by the guy who just inherited the environment and didn't know anything about it and we'd have to explain how things work because they were never trained. Or when we'd end up on the party support calls where every tech guy in the company hops on to insert their wisdom about every little issue with the products then we’d find out that despite being told that no one made any changes, the low guy on the totem pole guy eventually chimes in, \"well, we did make that one change last week...\".  \\*facepalm\\*.  And there was always that customer that say, \"well, while I have you, let me ask you about this other issue...\" when they knew they should be opening another ticket OR could've easily found the answer themselves if they just opened Google.. so the case just drags on all while other customers are being pushed further back.\n\nI would imagine current issues aren’t related to Broadcom at all.  I would assume the bulk of delay in support these days is for customers who ignored the EOL dates for 6.x and are now scrambling to upgrade but did no homework themselves to understand what’s involved.  So it’s a massive exercise in education rather than support and fixing broken things.  They’ll open cases and just assume support will walk them through the whole upgrade (then get upset when we wouldn't).  That was at least what I experienced back in the day and I’m sure it hasn’t changed.  All that just adds to the time to resolution and overall backlog.\n\nNot only that, current VMware products have become so complex that new engineers may have to truly rely on back line help because a lot of the training is about using the products and troubleshooting techniques not necessarily on all the creative ways customers break their environments.  VMware also really promoted from within and encouraged career growth, so most of the good engineers in the trenches probably moved on to other roles and the new ones are still getting up to speed.  There was always a staffing issue and I doubt that has changed much but generally speaking, the customers unknowingly created the burden on the engineers, not the other way around - that is, it was probably hard to staff for customer behavior rather than anticipated volume.  Long story short, if you knew how to work with the system and not against it (and didn't try to game it) you’d usually be fairly content with the support offering.  The ones that complained were often the impatient, pushy and sometimes incompetent ones.\n\nI am now back as a customer and while I won't say every support experience has been perfectly smooth, the vast majority of them have met all our expectations, but as with anything, your mileage may vary.\n\nedit: formatting",

Also, as an IT Director, I find the expectation that customers give you everything the need to resolve the issue prior to troubleshooting to be ludacris.  My support staff will get the information needed to resolve an issue by any means necessary.  I don't tolerate them acting like things need to be delivered on a silver platter.  I've found that In most cases a 20 minute phone call easily negates the need for 4 hours and solves an issue about 2 weeks faster.  Fault doesn't matter, blame doesn't matter, resolving issues as quickly as possible so we can move onto the next one is what matters.\n\nAs far as the move to ESX6 goes-I totally agree, but would say that in our case it would've been much easier if VMWare supported us.  We dropped NSX licensing and they refused to help us get rid of it because we didn't having licensing.   This meant a move to standand dvswitch, rebuild of hosts, and lift and shift to a new vcenter.   Also a change in DRS functionality delayed our go live for a week while we waited for an engineer who could tell us why our vCLS VM's wouldn't come online.",

        "selftext": "We're doing an RFI for S(A)SE, with the primary goal of replacing our classic VPN solution for both internet and private access.  In a second phase we're looking to introduce SD-WAN. \n\nA bit about us to set the context (feel free to skip):  We have \\~5k users, with a large campus (roughly 80-90% of employees are here), and about a dozen small(er) remote offices globally (mostly EU &amp; US).  Work from home is embraced widely.  On the server/app side we have a mix of on-prem DC (at the main campus), private cloud environments and SaaS - so all over the place :-).  The on-prem DC will remain critical for the foreseeable future, although there is a cloud first strategy so SaaS will increase.  We are currently a Palo Alto shop, but have no investment in SD-WAN yet.  We have a strong relationship with Microsoft (O365 and Azure) and have E5 licensing, which is why Microsoft got on the list in the first place even before their recent SSE announcement.\n\nWe have been talking to these vendors below, and this is my personal take-away about each of them.  Curious to hear where I'm wrong!\n\n* **Palo Alto** (disclaimer: we are a satisfied PA customer for NGFW so for us this seems like a natural fit)\n   * 100% public cloud (GCP mostly)\n   * Prisma access sounds more like an evolution of their existing NGFWs: \"make it virtual and stick it in the cloud\", versus a more cloud-native solution.  So while they were very cool a couple of years ago, the cutting edge feeling is not there.  I'm not sure yet if that is a good thing or a bad a thing, since we love our physical PAs :-) and we're told that many of the things we know (management, APIs, logging, etc) remains the same.\n   * SD-WAN is bolted on (former Cloudgenix) and is managed through a separate interface, although that should be better integrated into the cloud management solution?  Curious how well that would play out with a mix of SASE and physical firewalls.\n   * No backhaul to cloud needed for users to local DC traffic since policies across SASE and on-prem DC firewall should be transparent (?)\n   * Licensing seems a kludge!  (local/global, users/branches, service connections,....)\n   * Strong focus on client monitoring (ADEM): local wifi quality, CPU/MEM, etc...\n* **Netskope**\n   * CASB at origin.\n   * Own hardware in colocation DCs.\n   * More cloud-native and 'zero trust' by design with a \"connector\" VM that you run close to the resources that the client needs to get to.\n   * Local \"edge\" available to prevent backhaul from users to local DC via cloud while still ensuring the full security stack.  But just recently announced.\n   * SD-WAN is bolted on (former Infiot) and is managed through a separate interface.  Sounds like this should improve.\n   * \"Experience monitoring\" available but does not monitor the client itself (see above with ADEM).\n* **Zscaler**\n   * SWG at origin.\n   * Looks conceptually and architecturally very similar to Netskope: own hardware at colocation facilities, and a connector which builds an outbound connection from your DCs to the cloud.\n   * Also local edge available, like Netskope.\n   * No SD-WAN offering of its own, but partnering with major players.  However there is a \"branch connector\" which may sort of replace the SD-WAN capabilities by at least allowing to tie in branch offices into the Zscaler cloud platform.  This is only a VM now but I hear this will also become available as a physical box (?)\n   * Monitoring does include client statistics like CPU/Mem, wifi, etc.\n   * All in all Zscaler seems a bit more mature than Netskope (API ecosystem, etc). -&gt; looking forward to hear comparisons between Netskope and Zscaler!\n* **Cato**\n   * To me Cato seems to have the most \"complete\" architecture, with their SD-WAN appliances truly integrated into the entire solution, unlike the previous vendors.\n   * The SD-WAN boxes are part of the OPEX model which may or may not be nice, depending on your finance people :-)\n   * Unlike Netskope and Zscaler they provide actual IP to IP connectivity, no NAT behind connectors.\n   * However, seems less mature than the vendors above: limited API ecosystem, no real client monitoring,...\n* **Cisco**\n   * Just recently announced their new SSE offering, which is built from scratch (?) based on Umbrella and Duo technology.  Those are good products so that sounds promising.  But Cisco doesn't have the best track record of building out new products so I'm very hesitant to bet if this will become a true competitor to the others.\n   * For now 100% AWS only and limited POPs globally.\n   * Lots of features are \"roadmap\".\n* **Microsoft**\n   * Even more recently than Cisco, Microsoft this week also announced an SSE solution: Entra Internet access and Entra Private access.\n   * Private access is based on the existing app-proxy technology, which is a known and stable technology - at least for web traffic at this point.\n   * Curious to find out what their security capabilities will be on the internet access part specifically, since they have not NGFW capabilities in-house today (?).  I have not really been impressed by Azure firewall so far.\n   * Licensing not clear - some features may be part of the E5 licensing?\n\nThis clearly seems like a hot market with completely new products/announcements left and right (Cisco, Microsoft), and lots of roadmap items with existing SASE vendors.  \nNote that we haven't done any POCs yet so this is all based on (tech) talks, (marketing) slides and vendor websites.  Next step for us is to select a few vendors for a POC.  Looking forward to your real-world experiences to help us in that decision.\n\nSome open questions:\n\n* What's your experience with impact to real-world traffic and your day to day life as a network/security admin, between the architecture of PA/Cato (*IP to IP*) versus Zscaler/Cato/Microsoft (*NAT behind some sort of connector*) \n   * Apps don't see the true client source IP.\n   * No more server-to-client connectivity possible.\n   * Seems more complex for troubleshooting/visibility? But that should just move to the SASE cloud?\n* What's your opinion/experience on Netskope vs Zscaler?  Pros/cons?  \n* What are your experiences with TAC support with any of these vendors?\n* Pricing? :-)",

            "body": "Cato Networks integrator here.. started working with them before SASE was even defined (mid 2019).\n\nAs an engineer POV: they've really nailed down how to do the basics in a really simple manner. Visibility into traffic is top notch with real time statistics, historical and a very detailed event log. Automation could be a little better for very large enterprise using the APIs but those are in heavy development, we already do a lot of monitoring directly through the APIs as well. The platform development goes FAST unlike any vendor I've seen and yet I have the impression their QA works well since we've ran into very few bugs on our install base in any of the last 4 years. I also notice we've been replacing particularly lots of Palo Alto and Cisco deployment in the last 12 months now.\n\nFrom a commercial POV: The Cato story is very different to bring to a customer since it's unlike any architecture I've come across in the last 15 years of professional networking. They essentially defined what is SASE. None of our migrated customers have looked back to \"classic\" tiered networking with SD-WAN/firewalling/SSLVPN split. Most of them come in through the idea of running SD-WAN but when they hear you get built-in security and SDP they often go a lot further than initially planned and jump onto the SASE train. Contracting is not very world shocking, which I think is a lost opportunity. You're still contracting for multiple years without a way to downsize. Usually I see customers expanding rather than shrinking though.. Sizing is done in terms of bandwidth per site, SDP users and required security tiers.",

            "body": "The argument would be you get the best solution for secure, private connectivity across any use case (remote user, site, server-server, etc), and you direct the internet-bound traffic to the SWG etc.\n\nI will share a comparison of the open source (OpenZiti) vs ZPA, which I have written already and to hand.\n\n*Zscaler ZPA claims to be the world’s most deployed ZTNA platform. It applies the principles of least privilege to give users secure, direct connectivity to private applications while eliminating unauthorized access and lateral movement. It is built on top of the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange offering and can be deployed in hours to replace legacy VPNs and remote access tools by establishing a secure transport for accessing enterprise apps and services.ZPA provides a Client Connector application which is deployed on the end-user device that automatically forwards all user traffic through the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange to enforce policy and access controls, and App Connector provides the secure authenticated interface between a customer's servers and the ZPA cloud. The Global Zscaler Cloud stitches all components together. The Central Authority (CA) provides a central location for software updates and policy and configuration settings.*\n\n*OpenZiti has many similarities to ZPA. ZPA differs as OpenZiti is the only solution combining software-defined networking (SD-WAN-like) and zero trust functions. This means that OpenZiti can support any use case, from remote access to multi-cloud, DevOps, IoT, site-level connectivity or even ‘east-west’ within a local network. In contrast, Zscaler only supports client-to-server connectivity, across the WAN, for client-initiated applications and excludes certain protocols (e.g., VoIP, SSH). OpenZiti also has a much greater number of endpoints and support; while it has virtual appliances and hosts for all popular operating systems, it also including SDKs to embed in applications, serverless, webhooks, clientless, more constrained operating systems such as OpenWRT and a richer set of docker/Kubernetes endpoints (e.g., Daemon).*\n\n*OpenZiti has a system of embedded identity (CA, x509, &amp; JWTs) while cooperating with external IdP providers such as SPIFFE/SPIRE, OKTA, etc. ZPA, on the other hand, forces organisations to bring their own IdP as it does not have a system of embedded identity. This is also why clients must connect first to Zscaler and be authenticated. On the other hand, Ziti implements ABC (Authentication/Authorisation-Before-Connectivity). OpenZiti, using these certificates, implements mTLS whereas ZPA uses TLS - i.e., there is inherent trust in the Zscaler infrastructure not to be malicious. Ziti is also ‘crypto-agile’, so you can bring your own encryption - e.g., FIPS 140-2 or quantum - whereas ZPA is non-changeable.*\n\n*Zscaler operates a fully proprietary model – unlike OpenZiti, which is fully open source under Apache 2.0 license with a SaaS service through CloudZiti. Due to this model, you also need to backhaul all traffic to their Points of Presence run in private data centres across the globe. This introduces extra hops and latency while decreasing performance. On the other hand, OpenZiti provides the smart routing directly from the client via a fabric mesh which can be hosted in any location, including public or private cloud (or even your own house!) while providing high resiliency and performance. This is particularly useful if you want to operate a zero trust overlay in a local environment (e.g., a branch). Zscaler can turn off ZPA so traffic is not hair pinned to their PoPs. In contrast, OpenZiti can have an Edge Router in the local environment so that connectivity to servers/apps utilises the zero trust network overlay while staying local and not egressing to public networks.*\n\n*OpenZiti has also been designed from the ground up to be fully programmable using APIs and infrastructure-as-code with large investments into its own self-healing and operations to reduce the burden on operators.*\n\n*Finally, in a* [*recent thread on Reddit*](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/14f253t/upgrading_vpn_solutions_in_a_remote_working/)*, several people independently said Zscaler is complex, hard to work, costly, and difficult to get into POV/testing.*",

If it did mean something to you, note that their footprint in LATAM is not very significant and may not align with the markets you're in. \n\nPAN/CGX is a good pure play SDWAN product, but all its benefits are in east/west traffic only (private WAN traffic). You don't get last mile optimizations/SDWAN optimizations from that solution for internet-bound traffic.\n\nOf course, neither solution really has security built into it without purchasing another product. Naturally, PAN would/could sell you their edge NGFW, Primsa Access, etc. \n\nAryaka, for a long time, partnered with PAN. I think they also partner with Checkpoint. \n\nNot to toot my own horn (full disclaimer, I work for Cato Networks), but you would get the best of all worlds with Cato. You get the benefits of a cloud backbone, SDWAN last mile optimizations for all directions of traffic and the option of a fully converged security stack if that ever became applicable. The Cato Cloud consists today of just over 80 PoPs, so cloud service density is higher than both PAN (Prisma) and Aryaka. By the way, PAN sells their cloud footprint as more than 100 PoPs, but don't be fooled. They have a page where you can look up where services are actually delivered from. SDWAN, for example, only delivers orchestration in a handful of PoPs. SWG services with Prisma are in something like a dozen PoPs or maybe a little more. They make this info publicly available. Still no \"SDWAN\" (last mile optimization) to the public internet though.",

Cato has a feature called Speed Tunnelling, or Bypass, where you can specify a source or destination IP, protocol or port in the management interface to bypasses Cato entirely and put the traffic directly on the internet. This was a perfect answer to our question. We have a site with 10Gbps WAN and want to pump large backups offsite to a local DC, but don't want to be rate limited to our Cato license (it might be just 250Mbps).

Meraki hardware bound and limited to finite resources that reside in an appliance. Secure Connect another product with additional policy sets and context. Meraki is easy, but also very rudimentary in many ways when it comes to network management and network policies. It's not to say that Meraki or Cisco Viptela isn't a great SD-WAN solution or good enough for your needs, but when you start talking about the longer-term strategy (of SASE), that initial value in SD-WAN starts to dilute over time.",

For the past 8-10 months i've been working with Palo Alto, and FortiNet team. We determined Palo Alto was too expensive, and FortiGates were right in budget range, even with the FortiSASE product.\n\nHowever, we have an Aryaka from our main DC to secondary DC via SD-WAN, Fully managed by them. its been a great product and never had issues. Someone from our team introduced Aryaka to our project, and they apparently have full (Subscription based as it seems) Firewall solution.\n\nI know nothing about Aryaka as far as Firewall capabilities go, and i'm wondering if anyone has any experience with their solution.\n\nWe run a SaaS out of our organization through HTTPs, so security is a concern for us, as well as performance. This is why i was leaning toward PA and Forti. We also have around 16 branch offices, that we want interconnected, so Forti was a very strong contender for this with their SDWAN capabilities in their firewalls, with FortiSASE.",

Fortinet's is alright, though I struggle to call it true SASE as it is not a single management plane. You have to manage the FortiGates on their own (or with FortiManager) and then manage FortiSASE separately. (There is some FortiManager capability these days with FortiSASE, but it's limited). Fortinet does not have their own backbone, so it also would have to be layered on top of your Aryaka which can be a little complicated. Though you are already doing this today so no big deal. \n\nAryaka is a good path to explore. They are a SASE provider and have the network backbone that it sounds like you are currently utilizing. This would bring your remote connectivity, firewalls, and SDWAN all into a single solution. My customers who do this love it. My only caution with Aryaka is that they grew up in the Network-as-a-Service/SDWAN space like you are currently utilizing. Their SASE and FWaaS is pretty immature and my customers who review it find it lacking features, especially if you are moving from a tradition solution like SonicWALL. \n\nIn addition to Aryaka, I would recommend you explore Cato Networks too. They are the leader in the SASE space and have a mature FWaaS that can replace on prem firewalls and brings the SSE component of remote users into a single platform. They also have the network piece, so if you find the solution meets your needs you could consolidate that network/SDWAN piece in to them as well. My customers tend to find Cato is a much more complete solution and tend to go this way. \n\nBest of luck on your search!",

You might just check out that sub r/fortinet.\n\nWith Cato, you get the benefit of a global backbone like Aryaka (99.999% SLA's), but Cato's global network is way more distributed than theirs which allows their cloud network/backbone serve up a massive performance advantage and a predictable service for both global and regional environments. They also have a completely unified single-pass security stack in their PoPs. Not many suppliers can tout \"single-pass\" anymore. With disaggregated services (on-prem, in cloud, etc.) they just can't offer single-pass and can't share context for optimal efficacy. With Cato, you can self-manage or get a fully managed solution. Even if you can't replace Aryaka between your primary &amp; secondary DC's (today), you can still deploy Cato (coexist) and extend the same kind of end-to-end optimization with Edge/Branch SD-WAN + backbone to your DC's and to the Internet for all your sites with full inline security inspection. Also unique, you get SD-WAN/last mile optimization to both WAN &amp; Internet/SaaS resources. This is something you can get through Ayraka as well, because they have a similar cloud architecture to Cato, but this is not something you will get with FortiSASE. \n\nWhat's available today on the truck with Cato is the following:  \nGlobal Network with 99.999 SLA  \nEdge SD-WAN  \nFWaaS  \nUniversal ZTNA  \nSWG  \nIPS  \nNGAM  \nCASB  \nDLP  \nEPP/EDR  \nXDR  \nDEM  \nand IoT/OT Security.\n\nPick and choose what you need. As your needs change, onboarding new services is a flip a switch and defining a policy (same UI). All the context of everything you integrated (IDP) in the solution thus far is available to any new service you enable, e.g. single shared context (which is unique to Cato). The solution is completely converged in a single codebase and has single UI. Being a cloud-native, there's no more DIY patching. Supplier maintains the platform 100%. It's easy and sophisticated.\n\nIf Cato isn't in the cards for consideration, then I would say consolidating on Aryaka feels more like a step forward. Going with Fortinet is a step backward, IMO.",

Pretty straightforward, right?\n\nNo, absolutely not.\n\nI log into the CF management page, and I am completely and totally lost as to where this setting might be.  I've been looking for over an hour.  I've gone through every single setting I could find and done a google search on the matter.  It seems Google, Bing, and DDG don't want to give me a straight answer of any kind regarding this.  Searching for \"change web server on cloudflare\" yielded results addressing how to ban an IP from your page, how to change where CF sends emails, and how to change DNS to use CF, but nothing, NOTHING, about what to do the change your server.  I somehow managed to stumble across forum entries on how to do this, and there are highly wordy instructions, that completely miss the mark on what to actually DO.  Their instructions are like this:\n\n&gt; What do I need to do at Cloudflare if I change my web host?  If you change the provider hosting your website, most of the work will  need to be done there. You will need to add everything to your new host.   Once this is done, however, you will need to update your DNS records in  Cloudflare to point to your new host.  To do this, you will need to find out what DNS records you need from  your new host. These will often appear in a DNS section of your control  panel. If they don’t, you will need to con…    \n\nWell, first part NO DUH.  Of COURSE \"most of the work needs to be done there\".  That's NOT helpful and should not even be included.  \n\nSecond part, the DNS in CF for this site is completely bassackwards.  There are two entries, the domain itself and the WWW, both CNAME entries, (CF isn't even their DNS authority, so I don't know how this can even change anything) that point to the CF site.  There is NOTHING about the IP address of the web server to change.  \n\nLastly, the part about \"you will need to find out what DNS records you need from  your new host\" make NO SENSE AT ALL.  Neither the old web server nor the new web server have ANYTHING to do with DNS.  They aren't DNS servers; they're web servers, and WHY would we need DNS records from the web servers?  If they're meaning ABOUT the web server, like an IP address, WHY would it be in DNS?  \n\nApparently, none of my coworkers know how this works, either.  \n\nWhat mentally deficient devs designed this garbage?  Did they have to actually SEARCH for people stupid enough to come up with this idiotic design?  \n\nDoes anyone here know enough about this bunch of horse leavings to let me know what I actually need to change to get CF to point to a new web server for this customer's site?",

[Here are the help pages on it.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup)\n\nIt's also an option that's only available to Business or Enterprise plans, both of which come with dedicated support from Cloudflare.\n\nBut I certainly don't see how this is a CF UI issue. I personally prefer the old UI, but I'm probably just more used to it. Even with the new one, it didn't take me over an hour (or anywhere close) to find the DNS page.\n\nAnd, from your comment, it doesn't sound like it took you that long either. It sounds like your problem is that, once you found it, you had no idea what to do with it, which is certainly not a UI issue.\n\nThere are basically 2 options here:\n\n1) The DNS is hosted by Cloudflare, in which case, the partial CNAME setup is unnecessary &amp; redundant and the DNS should just point directly to the server.\n\nor\n\n2) The DNS isn't hosted by Cloudflare, in which case, you should use the partial CNAME setup on the actual DNS, which is wherever you're hosting it, and the DNS on Cloudflare should still point directly to the server.\n\nIf you have a DNS record on Cloudflare's DNS that's pointed to {your-hostname}.cdn.cloudflare.net, [which is the record that goes on the authoritative DNS for the Partial CNAME setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/setup/), then you, someone you work with, and/or someone you work for fucked up massively. That not only has nothing to do with the UI, but nothing to do with Cloudflare itself.\n\nThe only DNS records that should be on Cloudflare should be those for the server. Whether you get there via the Partial CNAME Setup or by using Cloudflare's nameservers, that endgame is still the same.\n\n&gt;the MX record is pointing to the customer's server\n\nYeah, I don't know what the heck you're doing--not made any easier by your choice of nomenclature (I have no idea what your company \"handling the DNS\" means: are you hosting it? Having someone else host it while you just keep it updated? What?)--but I'm pretty confident that you're either drastically misunderstanding/misstating what's happening here or someone else who set this up drastically misunderstood what they were doing.\n\nBut I do know that, whichever of those 2 it is, it has nothing to do with Cloudflare's UI. Or Cloudflare at all.",

Plus, this config was set up differently from the other two.  (They were horrible about training, where I was given a series of videos to watch for all my training, which were anywhere from 40 minutes to two hours with maybe 15-20 minutes of actually useful info.  That was supposed to be done on our own time, as well.)  And, yes, it was my job to support this.  The customer architected it, and our delivery department implemented it, while support had no input on the decision.  \n\n(Hence why I left that horrible job: being told I'm to support things while having little training, no experience, and no help from coworkers.  The stress from it was literally killing me.  I gained 45lbs, had an average of 4 hours of sleep per night, and chipped three teeth from grinding my teeth in my sleep in the 9 months I worked there.

[Here's the relevant FAQ, with links to the relevant pages.](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017421192-Cloudflare-DNS-FAQ#:~:text=nameservers%20to%20Cloudflare.-,Can%20I%20use%20Cloudflare%20without%20changing%20my%20nameservers%20to%20Cloudflare,of%20our%20certified%20hosting%20partners.)\n\nWhat the OP is dealing with is, at best, an extremely non-standard implementation of Cloudflare's services, which is not aided by their apparent lack of understanding of the subject matter.\n\nEither way, the situation as they describe it certainly doesn't mesh with how Cloudflare actually works.",

Both of those ways include putting the relevant webserver info, not a Cloudflare CNAME, in the Cloudflare DNS records.\n\nThe reason you're only finding the Cloudflare CNAME in the Cloudflare DNS records is because you, or some idiot who worked on this site before you, decided to configure it in that stupid manner.\n\nThat's not Cloudflare's fault. I can't tell you whose fault it is, because I don't work with you, but I know it's not Cloudflare's.\n\nThere are literally 2 options:\n\n1) Cloudflare is the DNS host and all the DNS records for the webservers, mail servers, etc. are on Cloudflare\n\n2) Someone other than Cloudflare is the authoritative DNS server. The authoritative DNS host contains the Cloudflare CNAMEs for the subdomains being proxied (and any other DNS records that aren't being proxied, like the mail server) and the Cloudflare DNS records contain only the webserver DNS records for the subdomains being proxied. \n\nThat's it.\n\nAnything else, like the Cloudflare DNS record containing a Cloudflare CNAME instead of the webserver information or containing the MX record despite not being the authoritative DNS server, is the result of someone who doesn't know what they're doing messing with something they shouldn't be touching.\n\nYour problem absolutely is the work of an idiot.

This comes down to the ability to perform very computational intensive functions (think SSL encryption/decryption, IPS scanning, high volume data processing \\[i.e. 10 Gbps+ flows\\]) in hardware instead of software.  This may sound like a cool party trick but in reality, this provides real benefits  because while these functions are being handled by the ASICs, the main CPU (think Intel/AMD/ARM) can be used to perform over functions (such as loading routes into the FIB from BGP, Zero Trust Network Access evaluation of the connecting client, Network Access Control to tell managed FortiSwitches to put the recently connected device into the correct VLAN, etc.).  So in a nutshell, it really makes the performance of any other comparable firewall unmatched its (the FortiGate) capabilities because the hardware is purposefully designed for network security.\n\n*Thanks for coming to my TED talk.*",

There’s truth to that being that their support is pretty good, they are a market leader, and they make same damn good equipment.. and what they cannot make themselves, they buy through acquisitions.  We use Cisco, both campus and datacenter, and the company I work for is amazing at keeping things under support, and paying for premium coverage (never an issue getting budget for those things).  If the company is willing to pay, I’m happy to buy Cisco… they also offer some of the best training, and while it’s focused on Cisco specific equipment, it carries well to other vendors and equipment.  For a long time, Cisco was the company leading the pack, and in some ways still are.\n\nNot knocking on others.. there’s a lot of good network equipment vendors out there that are better than Cisco. Especially in the provider and ISP markets, as well as the SD-Networking (though, I hear ACI has got better).  But for many businesses and enterprises, Cisco is great; and it’s easy to hire people who have experience (applies to people looking as well, a lot of companies run Cisco and it’s a perk to have experience).",

I entered into the field almost 20 years ago as a Cisco bigot but there are too many mature products now for me to just take them as a given.\n\nNot really going into our own use cases at access, distribution, and core layers of our network, their firewalls suck.  We had ASAs, and when it came time to replace them we were trying to decide between their new FTDs and Palo.  I liked that Palo seemed to be built from the ground up with next gen features - the interface was clean and you had all the management features in one place.  Unfortunately we heeded the advice of the Cisco partners and bought FTD and really regretted it.  (See my comment elsewhere if you want to hear more).\n\nWe had UCS for our server infrastructure and then went with their HyperFlex solution when hyperconvergence was starting to enter the scene.  It was a hot mess anytime we tried to update it.  Cisco just sunsetted it so now we are going to have to replace it all with something else.\n\nOn a more personal note, they invalidated a pile of certs I had when they got rid of those tracks, leaving me with no way of renewing those and nothing to show for in the extra efforts around security and wireless.  Just CCNA makes it sound like I just do route/switch.  Yes, I know people say to move on to CCNP and beyond, but I see no incentive to continue paying dues into a cert system where they don’t hold up their end of the bargain to endorse me in the agreed skills.",

It was a good thing I did because even that was barely enough for our workloads and the cheaper wouldn't have actually worked.  Evidently it came as a surprise just how much RAM the SpringPath VMs chew up just to make the platform function.  It was just over 72GB on each server.\n\nWe had converged infrastructure before that with UCS blades and an EMC VNX storage system and it seemed to work well, if not just a little overkill for our size.\n\nWhat's worse is that we had just refreshed the Fabric Interconnects a few months before the sunsetting announcement because they didn't do it when we replaced the blades.  It's still nutty to me that Cisco licenses the ports on those.  You already ponied up the cash for these very sophisticated interconnects with all these ports, but if you want to actually use the ports you have to pay an additional $1K for each of them.",

        "selftext": "We're looking at doing a refresh for our firewalls. For budget reasons our two main contenders seem to be Fortigate and Checkpoint.\n\nGeneral office setup: no fancy routing so the edge devices will connect directly to the ISP over 10 Gig. Probably won't need BGP, but if we do in the future, it won't be any fancy (one ASN, one block of IPv4/6). Some SSL VPN will be used, but not heavily.\n\nCurrently there will be only one fibre, but we'll probably get a second unit as a warm stand-by, so if the primary goes sides ways we could perhaps just move the fibre over. We may go with a second uplink later.\n\nAny preferences for Fortigate and Checkpoint? Palo Alto is often recommended, but that's a bit too much for us; Fortigate generally is also mentioned, but I'm curious about Checkpoint.\n\nOur co-lo DC will also probably need a refresh soon-ish, so we may go with the same vendor there as well. It's also currently 10Gig without HA. There we may stay with 10 Gig with the refresh, or perhaps go with a 100 Gig optic: not so much for the extra bandwidth, but for easier work with regards to provisioning and port availability: any difference with Fortigate and Checkpoint for 100G?\n\nThanks for any info.\n\n(Internally the office gear will be access-layer PoE switches, APs, and a small server room. More familiar with switching gear, so have a good feel for the options.)",

There are some quirks and limitations, but they've become the \"standard\" for non-PA installs for a lot of the market.\n\nThen based on their experience, a bunch of people will jump in saying the following are great or horrible: SonicWall, WatchGuard, CheckPoint, Sophos XGS. With Fortinet, they make up the majority of the market.\n\nYou'll have a very small group saying you should use pfSense or similar. Honestly considering your size... Maybe? I wouldn't, but some people do use them in production. You'll just be doing more legwork to get the security side up to par, but it's doable.\n\nCisco as a firewall shouldn't be an option unless you've used them before, and you're die-hard for Cisco. Meraki is easier to manage, but has way less features. I've used them both and I'd avoid personally but there's a small group that are into them.\n\nUniFi: No. It's a firewall the same way a Linksys is. This sub also hates their networking hardware, but I only hate their firewalls as I know the rest of the lineup well enough to get it to work reliably. And I'll still tell you, no to a UDM.\n\nI've worked on all of the above and honestly, they all have goofy quirks, bugs, and dumb limitations sprinkled here and there. I haven't found a firewall I loved since Sophos UTM got discounted in favor of XG. Your best bet is to get demo units or spin up demo virtual machines if possible, and then see how much you like each, because you'll be the one to use it regularly.\n\nI will say if you decide on Sophos, only get the XGS line of hardware.

Its documented and not difficult to do, but its not default behavior when creating HA partnerships.\n* You make a change on a FGT, it's live. No commit. No review. No \"you sure about that buddy\". It's live. Some may view this as a pro, others a con. \n* Security policies based on Application mapping. PAN shines brightly here. FGT does it, but I find it quirky by comparison.\n* Settings that can only be made via the CLI. Like non-default (514) syslog port destinations, multiple ntp servers, and a few others I have come across managing FGT's.\n\nPlaces where FortiGates shines:\n\n* Documentation\n* Documented performance - none of the \"in theory it can do XXX throughput for this feature, so long as its doing nothing else\". Allows for easier capacity planning and hardware research.\n* In a smaller environment, Fortilink is pretty awesome, if you drink the Forti-KoolAid. The ability to configure your FortiStack from the ForiGate to FortiSwitch to ForiAP to FortiOtherDevice from a single ForiInterface is pretty FortiAwesome.",

Stupidly simple to setup\n\nLooking ahead to SASE, Cisco is converging their SASE portfolio (Secure Access) into Meraki so you can manage it all from a single pane of glass. Each Meraki appliance would act as a VPN proxy. Definitely worth a look.\n\nFortinet is always high on this list which always surprises me. I think it’s because of the added benefit of having a nextgen firewall that’s really good and $0 licensing for SDWAN. Def worth a look\n\nPalo Alto acquired CloudGenix and frankly I think their entire offering is a little confusing. Ask your rep for a diagram. Prisma Access and Prisma SDWAN are expensive and IMO still has a way to go before everything is integrated seamlessly. With that said if you can afford it for your number of users, it’s certainly a very powerful offering.\n\nYou should ask yourself what you’re looking to get out of this. Simplicity and ease of management, or do you have more advanced requirements? Are you just going to add this into your existing architecture or redefine your entire WAN edge? And what will your private / cloud access requirements be in the future, hence why SASE integration is important when considering SDWAN. Integrating a cloud firewall with the solutions is key in my opinion.\n\nI have not experienced the others on this list, but but I’ve never heard bad things about them.\n\nI would avoid Velo sadly. What a shame Broadcom has done to their entire portfolio. Early on people thought the Broadcom acquisition would not impact this particular product, but it did.",

Sure, it's a data quality issue but other legacy products do a better job to compensate.\n\nFinally, the limited criteria you can use in a DLP policy means that 1 policy in a legacy solution becomes 10 policies in Netskope.\n\n  \nAs an extra, and this might not be an issue for others, I don't like the multiple levels they use and you cannot drill down easily: A policy, uses a profile, that uses rules, that uses entitities... The policy also uses categories that use url lists. Well, when you open a policy, you only see the top objects (e.g. the names of a user group, a category and a profile), you have to browse around outside the policy to see the details so it takes a lot of clicks to understand what a policy does.",

Working backwards from a product is saying you have a hammer and are asking what nails you need to hit.\n\nThree primary capabilities you want out of a SASE are as follows:\n\n* CASB/HTTPS inspection proxy: allowing for web filtering, DLP, malware protection, and analytics.\n* ZTNA, as in a network overlay with fine grained access control based on identity and services, as opposed to location or IP ranges.\n* Authenticated Proxies, for allowing remote access via a browser without additional software.\n\nThe first one gets provided by any security focused inspection proxy. Zscaler does a good job. So does most firewall vendors.\n\nThe second one (in my opinion) is actually kinda terrible to try to solve with SASE. Most places I've seen attempt it just end up with a VPN but worse, usually due to the complications involved with using a web proxy to solve a layer 3 problem. Worst case, you end up with a half implemented ZPA and a VPN because you never got it good enough to actually make a switch.\n\nModern VPNs introduce ACLs and/or peer to peer scaling that make the SASE value add non-existent for ZTNA. Tailscale, Zerotier, etc. are very simple to implement and get the job done. Alternatively, SD-Access/SDLAN solutions integrated with a regular VPN will also do the job.\n\nThe third one is becoming a normal commodity, available with pretty much all identity providers. Entra ID, for example, offers an application proxy built into most M365 offerings.",

            "body": "I was going to post something about my first experience with PAN support in a while. My first experience with PAN was 2013 so ~8 years ago. Back in the day I could get support on the phone ~5 minutes pretty regularly and they were pretty patient even with pretty basic questions. I once forgot about a PAN support agent was on hold for maybe 20-30 minutes while I checked a machine with my first experience with SSL Decrypt back in the 6.x days and he was still there when I came back. Fast forward to today and you're lucky if you can get someone on the phone in an hour and even if you tell them to call you they will email you and you're trying to get a appointment.\n\n My last experience with support was pretty underwhelming. I was trying to push to a new PA-220 from Panorama and was getting an error of phantom address object conflicts. I sent them the tech support file for both the FW and Panorama and even after days of \"working\" on it they didn't seem to have any meaningful suggestions. They kept trying to rename the existing objects in Panorama and we kept getting new conflicts. The support rep clearly in over their head brought in another support rep who suggesting importing the config from the new FW claiming that the \"recommended\" way nevermind I never did that just to push config. After over 2 hours on the phone I eventually said I needed a break. I spent maybe 20 minutes searching through KB articles on removing existing imported configs and found [one](https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id=kA10g000000Cmd6CAC) noting how to disable Panorama policy and objects. I disabled it then re-enabled it and then pushed again and voila it worked without issue. I put a request to close the case telling them how I fixed my problem that worked and wasn't the bizarre suggestion that the more \"experienced\" rep was suggesting. I have been called twice from PAN reps asking my thoughts on the ticket and made it clear I wasn't giving a good evaluation on the their support tech.  I had a few techs that wasted my time back in 2018, but I feel that the probability you get a good rep on the first try is much lower than it used to be.\n\nConsidering PAN afaik has never turned profit I can understand their desire to try and move towards profitability at some point, but I think that the more logical path if they want to cut costs would be to cut the frivolous marketing.  Even during the pandemic they found ways to spend like having pricey speakers for their marketing events who IMHO didn't even have relevance to InfoSec. e.g. I recall they brought in Condoleezza Rice and Marques Brownlee in another.",

Tier 1 guys learn by escalating tickets and getting answers back from smarter people.

It’s true, secure authentication that enables ANY IP-based communication to run through an overlay, requiring authentication before connection. This makes the system robust without relying on trust assumptions.\n\nImplementing OpenZiti has been, without a doubt, the best technology decision for my business. Not only does it secure everything by default, but it also simplifies the process of deploying new applications, saving both time and resources.",

Now I’m lucky if I get 10%.  \n\nMy recent experience with deal registration has it taking much longer to get responses around discounting, and Fortinet is seeking a lot more information around how we are scoping, pitching and presenting, and makes us burn hours of time discussing the opportunity before allowing deal reg, in some cases even refusing it until we force the customer into another demo so they can visit the client with us.\n\nThey’ve gone from being our simplest vendor to deal with, with the best support experience, to a needlessly frustrating vendor to deal with, in the space of 3.5 - 4 years.

Where support and service purchases alone enjoy a maximum of 15% discount without additional special approvals. The budget planning take-away here is that If you’re planning a 3-5 year lifecycle for the hardware, definitely do the budget reach to purchase all 3-5 years of support bundled with the hardware on day one. It will be a meaningful savings over yearly renewals, and significantly reduce total cost of ownership over the hardware lifecycle. (Not to mention, other than a large scale EA, bundling for lifecycle is the only way to insulate against price increases for the next five years!)",

        "selftext": "We've had constant compaints about the speed people are getting through our older Cisco Meraki VPN and have been trialing zScaler for replacing it.  We went through with an engineer and configured policy to allow all for now so we can get an idea of what is blocked and what will work and won't.  One thing I've noticed is that the speed of zScaler ZPA is about half of what the old Cisco VPN is.  Our workload is mainly Windows file shared (SMB) and we use the Cisco VPN to connect directly to an office for remote workers.  If, say, an office is Denver, CO, the user connects to a Colorado POP and can get to the office via an App Connector I deployed there, no issue.  The speed when trialing a worker's workflow takes twice as long though.  I've measured with various tools.  What gives?  Is this just the technology?  I was under the impression that it should be somewhat faster because of the lower overhead of the encryption.  Advice?",

Each office has it's own specific server that each remote worker would need to connect to.  As I understand it, you can't really tell zScaler to point a specific person to a PSE.  It only uses it according to some zScaler proximity or via an override telling it distance from the PSE to use, which won't work for a worker on the East coast that needs to connect to a file server in California.",

You mentioned your performance is great already, so the value of improved network performance through Aryaka might not be relevant to you. If it did mean something to you, note that their footprint in LATAM is not very significant and may not align with the markets you're in. \n\nPAN/CGX is a good pure play SDWAN product, but all its benefits are in east/west traffic only (private WAN traffic). You don't get last mile optimizations/SDWAN optimizations from that solution for internet-bound traffic.\n\nOf course, neither solution really has security built into it without purchasing another product. Naturally, PAN would/could sell you their edge NGFW, Primsa Access, etc. \n\nAryaka, for a long time, partnered with PAN. I think they also partner with Checkpoint. \n\nNot to toot my own horn (full disclaimer, I work for Cato Networks), but you would get the best of all worlds with Cato. You get the benefits of a cloud backbone, SDWAN last mile optimizations for all directions of traffic and the option of a fully converged security stack if that ever became applicable. The Cato Cloud consists today of just over 80 PoPs, so cloud service density is higher than both PAN (Prisma) and Aryaka. By the way, PAN sells their cloud footprint as more than 100 PoPs, but don't be fooled. They have a page where you can look up where services are actually delivered from. SDWAN, for example, only delivers orchestration in a handful of PoPs. SWG services with Prisma are in something like a dozen PoPs or maybe a little more. They make this info publicly available. Still no \"SDWAN\" (last mile optimization) to the public internet though.",

So if you sell this, you still have $950K to go. Other companies will only pay you half the commission as opposed to what you earn selling new.\n\nOr, They offer up a highly discounted “refresh” for $75K, of which you’ll save some money up front, and they’ll get credit for the full $75K, add a few deals like this in, and you’re quickly closing that gap.\n\nTo top it off, support renewals are a lot more work, being that these are account managers/execs they are here to help us solve our problems, the thing is, why would they want to do more work only to be paid less for it? Unfortunately this is from the top, as they want to drive new sales/subscriptions, so the pay plan is rigged this way to drive Account Team behavior",

        "selftext": "Hello r/cybersecurity,\n\n\n\nI'm a CS student (first year) currently interning at my university's Cybersecurity Department. I've been tasked with automating our monthly security metrics collection and reporting process, and I could use some advice from experienced professionals.\n\n\n\nI won't lie, I feel a little bit overwhelmed as this is a self-directed project and everything is new to me (although it means there's plenty of room for learning! I just learned what an API is...) \n\n\n\nCurrent situation:\n\n- The security team manually collects monthly metrics for executive reporting\n\n- Data sources include: CS, WAF, NGFW, and various security tools\n\n- Currently using Excel for data processing and PowerPoint for presentation\n\n- Process is time-consuming and manual\n\n\n\nMetrics we need to collect monthly:\n\n- Security incidents by technology\n\n- Tickets handled per institution\n\n- False positives\n\n- Received events (logs)\n\n- Vendor cases\n\n- IRT alerts\n\n- Security communications\n\n- OS vulnerabilities\n\n\n\nProject goals:\n\n1. Automate the collection and processing of these metrics\n\n2. Create automated/semi-automated dashboards\n\n3. Reduce manual work in the reporting process\n\n\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. What tools/software would you recommend for automating this process? Currently considering PowerBI, Kibana, but open to other suggestions. The department is open to considering both open source and paid solutions.\n\n2. For those using CS, WAF, or NGFW - how do you handle automated metrics collection?\n\n3. Any gotchas or lessons learned from similar projects?  \n\n\nAny advice is GREATLY appreciated. Thanks in advance!\n\n",

Be sure to configure your index lifecycle policies and be careful with the update/upgrade process.\n\nFor agent based vulnerability scanning, use the elastic agent with Fleet and OSQuery. Also, consider Wazuh for SCA and host vuln scanning.\n\n2. SIEM dashboards and supporting logic will gonkulate most of the metrics you might need.  For anything not covered by a SIEM, there’s Python and Pandas. The ELK stack with the security integration comes with a bunch of canned dashboards that are pretty ok.\n\n3. The ELK stack can be a tricky beast. I’d keep an eye on storage and resource utilization. I’d recommend having some VM snapshots of a known good state. \n\nFocusing on metrics and reporting prior to having mature security infrastructure is an instance of the cart being placed before the horse. I’d make sure that you have a solid inventory, configuration and patch management, comprehensive logging and monitoring and then focus on reporting and metrics.",

        "selftext": "We're doing an RFI for S(A)SE, with the primary goal of replacing our classic VPN solution for both internet and private access.  In a second phase we're looking to introduce SD-WAN. \n\nA bit about us to set the context (feel free to skip):  We have \\~5k users, with a large campus (roughly 80-90% of employees are here), and about a dozen small(er) remote offices globally (mostly EU &amp; US).  Work from home is embraced widely.  On the server/app side we have a mix of on-prem DC (at the main campus), private cloud environments and SaaS - so all over the place :-).  The on-prem DC will remain critical for the foreseeable future, although there is a cloud first strategy so SaaS will increase.  We are currently a Palo Alto shop, but have no investment in SD-WAN yet.  We have a strong relationship with Microsoft (O365 and Azure) and have E5 licensing, which is why Microsoft got on the list in the first place even before their recent SSE announcement.\n\nWe have been talking to these vendors below, and this is my personal take-away about each of them.  Curious to hear where I'm wrong!\n\n* **Palo Alto** (disclaimer: we are a satisfied PA customer for NGFW so for us this seems like a natural fit)\n   * 100% public cloud (GCP mostly)\n   * Prisma access sounds more like an evolution of their existing NGFWs: \"make it virtual and stick it in the cloud\", versus a more cloud-native solution.  So while they were very cool a couple of years ago, the cutting edge feeling is not there.  I'm not sure yet if that is a good thing or a bad a thing, since we love our physical PAs :-) and we're told that many of the things we know (management, APIs, logging, etc) remains the same.\n   * SD-WAN is bolted on (former Cloudgenix) and is managed through a separate interface, although that should be better integrated into the cloud management solution?  Curious how well that would play out with a mix of SASE and physical firewalls.\n   * No backhaul to cloud needed for users to local DC traffic since policies across SASE and on-prem DC firewall should be transparent (?)\n   * Licensing seems a kludge!  (local/global, users/branches, service connections,....)\n   * Strong focus on client monitoring (ADEM): local wifi quality, CPU/MEM, etc...\n* **Netskope**\n   * CASB at origin.\n   * Own hardware in colocation DCs.\n   * More cloud-native and 'zero trust' by design with a \"connector\" VM that you run close to the resources that the client needs to get to.\n   * Local \"edge\" available to prevent backhaul from users to local DC via cloud while still ensuring the full security stack.  But just recently announced.\n   * SD-WAN is bolted on (former Infiot) and is managed through a separate interface.  Sounds like this should improve.\n   * \"Experience monitoring\" available but does not monitor the client itself (see above with ADEM).\n* **Zscaler**\n   * SWG at origin.\n   * Looks conceptually and architecturally very similar to Netskope: own hardware at colocation facilities, and a connector which builds an outbound connection from your DCs to the cloud.\n   * Also local edge available, like Netskope.\n   * No SD-WAN offering of its own, but partnering with major players.  However there is a \"branch connector\" which may sort of replace the SD-WAN capabilities by at least allowing to tie in branch offices into the Zscaler cloud platform.  This is only a VM now but I hear this will also become available as a physical box (?)\n   * Monitoring does include client statistics like CPU/Mem, wifi, etc.\n   * All in all Zscaler seems a bit more mature than Netskope (API ecosystem, etc). -&gt; looking forward to hear comparisons between Netskope and Zscaler!\n* **Cato**\n   * To me Cato seems to have the most \"complete\" architecture, with their SD-WAN appliances truly integrated into the entire solution, unlike the previous vendors.\n   * The SD-WAN boxes are part of the OPEX model which may or may not be nice, depending on your finance people :-)\n   * Unlike Netskope and Zscaler they provide actual IP to IP connectivity, no NAT behind connectors.\n   * However, seems less mature than the vendors above: limited API ecosystem, no real client monitoring,...\n* **Cisco**\n   * Just recently announced their new SSE offering, which is built from scratch (?) based on Umbrella and Duo technology.  Those are good products so that sounds promising.  But Cisco doesn't have the best track record of building out new products so I'm very hesitant to bet if this will become a true competitor to the others.\n   * For now 100% AWS only and limited POPs globally.\n   * Lots of features are \"roadmap\".\n* **Microsoft**\n   * Even more recently than Cisco, Microsoft this week also announced an SSE solution: Entra Internet access and Entra Private access.\n   * Private access is based on the existing app-proxy technology, which is a known and stable technology - at least for web traffic at this point.\n   * Curious to find out what their security capabilities will be on the internet access part specifically, since they have not NGFW capabilities in-house today (?).  I have not really been impressed by Azure firewall so far.\n   * Licensing not clear - some features may be part of the E5 licensing?\n\nThis clearly seems like a hot market with completely new products/announcements left and right (Cisco, Microsoft), and lots of roadmap items with existing SASE vendors.  \nNote that we haven't done any POCs yet so this is all based on (tech) talks, (marketing) slides and vendor websites.  Next step for us is to select a few vendors for a POC.  Looking forward to your real-world experiences to help us in that decision.\n\nSome open questions:\n\n* What's your experience with impact to real-world traffic and your day to day life as a network/security admin, between the architecture of PA/Cato (*IP to IP*) versus Zscaler/Cato/Microsoft (*NAT behind some sort of connector*) \n   * Apps don't see the true client source IP.\n   * No more server-to-client connectivity possible.\n   * Seems more complex for troubleshooting/visibility? But that should just move to the SASE cloud?\n* What's your opinion/experience on Netskope vs Zscaler?  Pros/cons?  \n* What are your experiences with TAC support with any of these vendors?\n* Pricing? :-)",

            "body": "Cato Networks integrator here.. started working with them before SASE was even defined (mid 2019).\n\nAs an engineer POV: they've really nailed down how to do the basics in a really simple manner. Visibility into traffic is top notch with real time statistics, historical and a very detailed event log. Automation could be a little better for very large enterprise using the APIs but those are in heavy development, we already do a lot of monitoring directly through the APIs as well. The platform development goes FAST unlike any vendor I've seen and yet I have the impression their QA works well since we've ran into very few bugs on our install base in any of the last 4 years. I also notice we've been replacing particularly lots of Palo Alto and Cisco deployment in the last 12 months now.\n\nFrom a commercial POV: The Cato story is very different to bring to a customer since it's unlike any architecture I've come across in the last 15 years of professional networking. They essentially defined what is SASE. None of our migrated customers have looked back to \"classic\" tiered networking with SD-WAN/firewalling/SSLVPN split. Most of them come in through the idea of running SD-WAN but when they hear you get built-in security and SDP they often go a lot further than initially planned and jump onto the SASE train. Contracting is not very world shocking, which I think is a lost opportunity. You're still contracting for multiple years without a way to downsize. Usually I see customers expanding rather than shrinking though.. Sizing is done in terms of bandwidth per site, SDP users and required security tiers.",

            "body": "The argument would be you get the best solution for secure, private connectivity across any use case (remote user, site, server-server, etc), and you direct the internet-bound traffic to the SWG etc.\n\nI will share a comparison of the open source (OpenZiti) vs ZPA, which I have written already and to hand.\n\n*Zscaler ZPA claims to be the world’s most deployed ZTNA platform. It applies the principles of least privilege to give users secure, direct connectivity to private applications while eliminating unauthorized access and lateral movement. It is built on top of the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange offering and can be deployed in hours to replace legacy VPNs and remote access tools by establishing a secure transport for accessing enterprise apps and services.ZPA provides a Client Connector application which is deployed on the end-user device that automatically forwards all user traffic through the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange to enforce policy and access controls, and App Connector provides the secure authenticated interface between a customer's servers and the ZPA cloud. The Global Zscaler Cloud stitches all components together. The Central Authority (CA) provides a central location for software updates and policy and configuration settings.*\n\n*OpenZiti has many similarities to ZPA. ZPA differs as OpenZiti is the only solution combining software-defined networking (SD-WAN-like) and zero trust functions. This means that OpenZiti can support any use case, from remote access to multi-cloud, DevOps, IoT, site-level connectivity or even ‘east-west’ within a local network. In contrast, Zscaler only supports client-to-server connectivity, across the WAN, for client-initiated applications and excludes certain protocols (e.g., VoIP, SSH). OpenZiti also has a much greater number of endpoints and support; while it has virtual appliances and hosts for all popular operating systems, it also including SDKs to embed in applications, serverless, webhooks, clientless, more constrained operating systems such as OpenWRT and a richer set of docker/Kubernetes endpoints (e.g., Daemon).*\n\n*OpenZiti has a system of embedded identity (CA, x509, &amp; JWTs) while cooperating with external IdP providers such as SPIFFE/SPIRE, OKTA, etc. ZPA, on the other hand, forces organisations to bring their own IdP as it does not have a system of embedded identity. This is also why clients must connect first to Zscaler and be authenticated. On the other hand, Ziti implements ABC (Authentication/Authorisation-Before-Connectivity). OpenZiti, using these certificates, implements mTLS whereas ZPA uses TLS - i.e., there is inherent trust in the Zscaler infrastructure not to be malicious. Ziti is also ‘crypto-agile’, so you can bring your own encryption - e.g., FIPS 140-2 or quantum - whereas ZPA is non-changeable.*\n\n*Zscaler operates a fully proprietary model – unlike OpenZiti, which is fully open source under Apache 2.0 license with a SaaS service through CloudZiti. Due to this model, you also need to backhaul all traffic to their Points of Presence run in private data centres across the globe. This introduces extra hops and latency while decreasing performance. On the other hand, OpenZiti provides the smart routing directly from the client via a fabric mesh which can be hosted in any location, including public or private cloud (or even your own house!) while providing high resiliency and performance. This is particularly useful if you want to operate a zero trust overlay in a local environment (e.g., a branch). Zscaler can turn off ZPA so traffic is not hair pinned to their PoPs. In contrast, OpenZiti can have an Edge Router in the local environment so that connectivity to servers/apps utilises the zero trust network overlay while staying local and not egressing to public networks.*\n\n*OpenZiti has also been designed from the ground up to be fully programmable using APIs and infrastructure-as-code with large investments into its own self-healing and operations to reduce the burden on operators.*\n\n*Finally, in a* [*recent thread on Reddit*](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/14f253t/upgrading_vpn_solutions_in_a_remote_working/)*, several people independently said Zscaler is complex, hard to work, costly, and difficult to get into POV/testing.*",

        "selftext": "PA support used to be terrific, very responsive and knowledgeable. After going six months or so without having to put in a ticket, I've had several in the last month or two and support is suddenly TERRIBLE.\n\nThey don't know anything. They can't do anything. As soon as you put a ticket in, much of the time they immediately say they'll be \"checking on &lt;some term related to your ticket that they should already know about&gt; for the next 24 hours,\" during which time no work will be done on your ticket. They constantly put tickets into \"Waiting on Customer Feedback\" mode without moving them along at all and without actually asking you for any information.\n\nThis latest ticket, the tech sent me a KB article that I literally linked and informed him was useless and the reason why in the initial ticket description, and then informed me outside of my stated work hours that he'd tried to call me twice on a number that isn't mine or even in my state, then put the ticket in \"Waiting on Customer\" status. I responded to him that that wasn't my number, gave both of my numbers, both of which have been in my PA support account for seven years now and haven't changed, and received a reply that my number has been updated in their system with the correct number, and then the ticket was immediately put into \"Waiting on Customer\" status again without any attempt to contact me. That's exactly the quality of support and amount of support engagement you get at every stage of every ticket now.\n\nI have to involve my account manager to make any progress on any ticket. It's so, so bad, I'm-thinking-of-replacing-my-firewalls bad. I love the product and hoped never to have to work with any other firewall brand, but support is suddenly and utterly useless and worthless. I cannot recommend any product with support this bad. It's like the entire support organization is being gatekeeped behind three guys in a garage in Mumbai.\n\nI've been trying to get a Cortex Data Lake provisioned correctly and fully for multiple months now, as part of a Cortex XDR implementation project, and I'm yikesing that I've just bought several hundred $k further into a vendor that suddenly doesn't have useful or functional support.\n\nEdit: This is Premium support I'm talking about.",

U cannot randomly pick people and give them training, put them in an environment where u r expected to deal with the customers using palo. U need to filter the good ones and put them under scrutiny and then assign them stuff. This is how one would learn.  \n\nAs far as outsourcing is concerned Palo should remember to watch what their partners are doing in order to get the right talent and are they paid enough. U first have to fix the issue related to money and then see how talent evolves. Again u cannot expect a guy to know everything about the firewalls ,for bare minimum wage he is paid for being a contractor instead of direct employee.\n\n I heard from a few of my friends in TAC that they are now not even picking  the good ones from partners directly to palo. U lose the talent there itself after what they have grinded for so many years.\n\nSupport Partners screw the shit out of employees for bare minimum wage and eat up the money as their profits and the top ones happily live off by what the engineers grind. I'm not sure if palo is even aware off\n\nOne of my friends who was really good at these things had to drop becoz of the unwarranted pressure of metrics like some bullshit CSAT score, Resolution time and other shitty metrics coming in from the support partner who hires Contractors. That is where u have already lost talent lol\n\nHope Palo scrutinizes their partners in asking them to pay more to their employees and not eat up all those bonuses offered to them.",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone,  \nI need your help in selecting a suitable firewall for our company's main site. Here are the key facts and requirements:\n\n1. **Number of Users**:\n   * 130 internal users, typically 60-90 on-site.\n   * Depending on the load, there are 105-160 devices (WiFi only) in the internal network (1.75 devices per user).\n2. **Internet Bandwidth**:\n   * 1,000 Mbps (1 Gbps) for both download and upload.\n3. **VPN Connections**:\n   * 9 Site-to-Site VPN connections: 6 sites and 3 services (two interfaces and one web application) are connected.\n   * 70-110 simultaneous mobile VPN connections.\n4. **Applications and Services**:\n   * VoIP, video conferencing via Teams, cloud services like Microsoft 365, web applications, internal web applications, regular internet access.\n   * Internal servers (including file servers, application servers, database servers). These should be separated by network segmentation.\n   * We do not publish any services to the internet.\n5. **Throughput Requirements**:\n   * The internal infrastructure should perform well both internally and for VPN users (regardless of Site-to-Site or mobile VPN).\n   * Traffic within the infrastructure (server to storage) should not pass through the firewall – this runs in an internal storage network.\n   * Additionally, internet access from the main site should continue to perform well.\n6. **Security Features**:\n   * Including IPS, anti-malware, application control, TLS/SSL inspection, network segmentation, and routing.\n7. **High Availability**:\n   * Active-passive high availability solution desired.\n8. **Conditions**:\n   * For future planning, I would like to account for an annual increase in traffic of 5-10%.\n   * Additionally, we are looking for firewalls from the same manufacturer for the other sites. These sites do not have extensive infrastructure and need the firewalls mainly for local internet breakout and VPN connections to the main site.\n   * We are looking for a manufacturer that offers a good price-performance ratio and can meet these requirements for the next five years.\n   * A good VPN client for Windows and Android is very important to me. It must have good MFA integration. \n\nIt is particularly important to us that the firewall can provide both VPN throughput and throughput for all security features in parallel. Do you have any recommendations or experiences with specific models that could meet our requirements? Thank you in advance for your help!",

        "selftext": "Excuse my rant. I’m am curious if my experience is unique. \n\nIn January I decided to purchase two new Fortigates to replace some aging FGT50Cs. I decided to get two FWF60Fs. \n\nThis experience was miserable. \n\nJanuary: Ordered them from a VAR I have used in the past. They said the units are back ordered and would get back to me in a few days with an estimated ship date. I waited 6 weeks and heard nothing.  Canceled the order.  They screwed up the cancellation and charged me again for the same firewalls.  A dozen calls later I finally have my money back.  Sheesh. \n\nFebruary: Contacted a different, local VAR.  Delighted to have my business.  Decided to shift to 80F non wi-fi as they were in stock. Never got a quote. Was completely ignored.  \n\nMarch: Fortinet refers me to another VAR.  Wants to talk with me. I tell them I know what I want. I give them the skus and everything.  The mess up the quote.  Take three weeks to get back to me with a revised quote and it is wrong. \n\nApril: I go to CDW. They send me a quote.  It is wrong.  I ask for it to be updated. I am ignored. \n\nLate April: I finally wind up at Provantage which I bought some gear from a year ago.  Get a quote (correct), place and order, it shows up a week later. With good communication the whole time.  \n\nFinally. \n\nFive months, 4 different VARs to order two firewalls.  I know there are supply chain problems but this was terrible customer support across multiple VARs. \n\nWhy can’t I go on the internet, order a firewall and have it show up in a few weeks.  Amazon can do it. VARs are a huge pain in the a$$. \n\nThank you for listening to my rant.",

A few very large VARs may have the ability to buy directly as well. But here is the catch, the manufacturers require cash on shipment. They don't do net terms. They don't take returns.\n\nBasically, the manufacturers carry no accounts receivables, no bad debt and (mostly) no returns.  They \"outsource\" all of that work to the distributors like Synex and Arrow. (who you have probably never heard of).\n\nThe VARs buy from the distributors.\n\nI work for a VAR, but we aren't set up to take credit cards.

            "body": "**Cisco ASA**\nNo shortage of people who can help you configure it.  A lot of people learn firewalls on this platform.  Performance-wise it's pretty poor for the money.  Commodity hardware running Linux can match or exceed the performance of their heavy hitters (5585-X).  The NGFW functionality isn't really there (the only NGFW part of it is the Firepower add-on which will further degrade performance).  It's a decent firewall if you want a SPI firewall.  AnyConnect is the best client VPN solution out there.  If you're a Cisco shop soup-to-nuts and don't have a lot of bandwidth this can be a solid choice.  Cisco is excellent at detailed disclosure for security vulnerabilities and release notes which helps promote confidence.  If your major concern is something like PCI compliance Cisco is a great checkbox pick.  The ASA OS is based on Linux.\n\n**Juniper SRX**\nGreat CLI.  If you're a fan of Juniper you'll like this box.  Pretty much a Cisco ASA with a better CLI and more reasonable pricing.  Like the ASA not really a NGFW player but a solid pick for a traditional firewall.  The larger units look like they have some level of hardware acceleration based on Cavium network CPUs but it seems fairly limited.  JunOS is based on FreeBSD.\n\n**Fortinet FortiGate**\nThe founder started NetScreen to develop ASIC-based hardware accelerated firewalls.  A few years before Juniper bought NetScreen (now discontinued) he went off to start Fortinet with the same goal but expanding on that into more of a NGFW vision.  FortiGate has the best raw performance for the money of any of these offerings.  It's popular when you have high bandwidth needs.  FortiOS is based on Linux.  Both ScreenOS (NetScreen) and FortiOS were caught having backdoors which might keep you up at night.\n\n**Palo Alto Networks**\nFounded by Nir Zuk in 2005 (who worked at Check Point then NetScreen) Palo Alto is the new hotness right now.  Palo Alto has the best GUI hands-down and is focused on application awareness.  The combination of ease-of-use and ability to see (almost) everything has made it very popular.  It's also one of the highest priced.  If you're looking for an all-in-one solution and price is no object PAN might be the way to go.  That said when I did an extended demo I ran into more than a few service-affecting bugs across multiple versions and even had them enter weird states that were only resolved with a reboot.  I was impressed for the first day and less impressed after a few weeks.  PANOS is based on Linux.\n\n**Check Point Technologies**\nBased in Israel.  The claim to fame for Check Point is basically the invention of Stateful Packet Inspection (SPI) filtering (e.g. what everyone takes for granted today).  They've been around a long time and their former employees make up a disproportionate amount of security company CEOs and entrepreneurs.  They're basically the IBM of firewall companies.  High level of confidence in security and stability and good management tools for large deployments.  Can be expensive but the pricing is negotiated so it can vary greatly between people.  Like the ASA and SRX there isn't really the mature NGFW feature set that you'll see in PAN or FortiGate here.  At the end of the day it's obscure enough that you're stuck going specifically to Check Point for support.  As a result the ASA can pretty much deliver the same experience for a lower TCO here (IMHO).\n\nThese are the major players in the commercial space.  \n\nIf you don't have high bandwidth requirements and are looking for something that's primarily a SPI firewall then the Cisco ASA can be a pretty solid choice.  The Juniper SRX is in a similar category (think of it as a discount ASA with a nicer CLI).  If you're doing client VPN then it might be worth going with a dedicated ASA for that just to get AnyConnect (which is the best client experience available right now).\n\nIf you need high bandwidth (&gt; 1G) then you're really looking at FortiGate.  Their ASIC-based filtering is really hard to match.  I still don't feel good about recommending them with a common CEO being linked to his two firewall companies found to have backdoors.\n\nIf you want full web filtering with SSL inspection then you're looking at FortiGate or Palo Alto Networks.  Note that using this functionality will **significantly** decrease performance and break some applications and websites.  You might ultimately decided to just disable it.  Consider that before making it a deal breaker for the others.  Personally I prefer DNS-based filtering to proxy-based and SSL inspection (OpenDNS can be a good choice here.  They've been bough up by Cisco).\n\nIn terms of IDS and IPS I honestly think it's a disservice to perform these tasks on the firewall.  You're better off (IMHO) doing so out-of-band using a tap or SPAN into dedicated sensors.  This keeps IDS performance out of the critical path (increasingly important with denial of service attacks) and a company focused on IDS will usually do a better job than the IDS bundled with a firewall.  The dedicated Sourcefire appliances (the company founded by the creators of Snort and now owned by Cisco) is a good example.\n\nA lot of this comes down to your security architecture and whether you want an all-in-one magic box or if you're willing to combine discrete components in an overall architecture.  NGFW by definition is all-in-one but once people run into performance concerns or incompatibilities introduced by application filtering they often resort to disabling a lot of functionality leaving only the basic firewall in place.\n\nIn this respect the ecosystem of Cisco ASA plus OpenDNS plus Sourcefire (and even plus AMP) can be very competitive with things like Palo Alto.  The difference is that you're assembling multiple components.\n\nThe reason I mention all this is because (1) if you need to scale then you'll almost be forced to take this path and (2) if you don't need an all-in-one NGFW solution you can look at a wider range of solutions.\n\nIf you don't need to worry about being fired for not having someone to blame in the event of a breach and going the Open Source route is an option for you then there are some options there too.  There is a pretty good argument to be made for Open Source as a requirement for security infrastructure in a time when we're seeing state actors pressure even the most reputable technology companies to insert backdoors or methods to bypass controls and encryption.\n\n**VyOS**\nVyOS is a Linux-based network operating system.  Linux netfilter (iptables) is the most peer-reviewed packet filter implimentation in the world and has rock solid performance.  VyOS ties everything together to provide a consistent CLI and unified configuration file much like traditional network devices and as a recent development commercial support is available though some of the developers directly.  If you need a good SPI firewall VyOS can be a solid choice.  Using an 8-core CPU and 10GbE interfaces you can build a VyOS system that will handle over 10 Gbps for 512-byte packets and 20 Gbps for packets &gt; 1024 bytes (placing it in ASA 5585 territory) for under $1000 per unit.  I've been running production VyOS units at multi-gigabit traffic levels (4-5 Gb avg) without incident since release 1.0.1 (~ October 2011 for the first unit IIRC).  The stability has been rock solid.  The upgrades have been painless.  I was forced to go this path because the budget vanished but it's worked out remarkably well.  Today I have 40+ units in production (but the background in Linux and development to do so with confidence).\n\nYou can also look into things like OpenVPN for client VPN and Snort or Bro for IDS.  Depending on your scale that savings can go toward hiring more staff to focus on security (which is often the best use of limited funds).\n\nOne thing to watch out for is that a lot of vendors want you to believe that there is a Silver Bullet for security.  My experience says there isn't.  Because everyone is so concerned about security right now there seems to be infinite dollars available and a new company popping up every day to accept your money in exchange for the promise of security.  I honestly think it's a bubble and that in a few years there will be a reckoning when people ask if they're really more secure after dumping millions into Silver Bullet security solutions.\n\nIMHO you should focus on sound design practices.  Defense in Depth.  Lay out an architecture that takes more than the network into account and use risk management to identify where the biggest gains can be made for the least cost.  A lot of organizations focus so much on throwing money at a vendor and then thinking they're secure but neglect the basics like training people how to use a password manager or how to spot a phishing scam.  If I had a choice between a top-of-the-line Palo Alto Networks firewall and a dedicated staff member to focus on education and outreach I'd pick the staff member without hesitation.\n\nAs a disclaimer my background is as a network engineer first and security engineer second ... so my focus is more often on avoiding the introduction of performance bottlenecks and additional points of failure unless there is a good reason to do so.  This may make me come off a bit harsh towards things like SSL inspection and all-in-one firewalls.\n",

            "body": "We chose Palo Alto years ago when they were basically the only \"next gen\" (defined by me as application awareness and having IDS/IPS-like features built in rather than bolted on) firewall on the market at the time. ASA-X didn't exist yet and the main competition was Sidewinder which...yeah, no.\n\nPros:\n\n* Their performance is actually as good or better than they claim in most circumstances. If they say it's 2G with features turned on it can really handle that much traffic. Even the little 500-series firewalls can handle a surprising amount of traffic with all features (possibly excepting TLS decrypt; see below) turned on.\n\n* Good application recognition database, updated constantly.\n\n* HA is well-designed, we do maintenance and typically lose 2-3 pings during failovers and application impact is minimal.\n\n* Applications are a first-class feature, meaning you can use them in regular firewall rules to enforce policy, not just see them in reports later.\n\n* Good support, especially if you get past tier 1.\n\nCons:\n\n* Fairly expensive, including the recurring support costs, and if you stop updating signatures they become useless pretty fast.\n\n* Although it's improved a lot in the past two years, some fairly significant software bugs have crept in at times.\n\n* Like most vendors their solution does not play super well if you're going to a cloud/hybrid setup anytime soon. The platform relies on a pile of FPGAs to get good performance so turning that into a Xen VM is...suboptimal.\n\nOne thing I'd caution in general is that a lot of traffic, including app to app, is starting to get encrypted by default. This greatly hampers the effectiveness of platforms like these since they either see streams of TLS going back and forth and thus lose nearly all L7/application awareness, or you do TLS decrypt on all traffic which is its own pile of issues. My guess is that the era of NGFW may be winding down, and that we should be more interested in flow analytics and very granular (host-level) L4 ACLs to control traffic vs. trying to pull everything through monstrous firewalls. Just my opinion though, I could be wrong.\n",

The learning curve isn't too bad and Cisco TAC is typically incredibly good. I'd say it's middle to high price depending on what you need it to do and at what speed. Difficult to impossible centralized management or reporting in my experience, or at least you need 3rd party tools. Easy to buy, renew licenses, quote out, etc.\n\nPalo Alto: Expensive, but rather easy to use. It's the 'new hotness' out there, but there's a lot of questions (in my humble opinion and echo chamber) about how good they actually are. Can be managed and reported on fairly easy. Did I mention expensive? I have little to no experience buying or renewing these.\n\nFortinet: The cheapest out there for what they do, and their support is terrible - like really terrible. However, the more recent hardware and OS versions are pretty stable. Easy to use GUI, but a lot of advanced features are hidden in CLI. A little learning curve, but once it clicks it's easy to use. Very robust feature set, but you need to size the box appropriately. Very easy centralized management and reporting if you want to go that route. If you pick a good partner to use it's easy to get discounts from 10-40% pretty often.\n\nCheck Point - Also expensive, but a market leader for a long time for a reason. A steep, steep learning curve. Very feature heavy but requires a lot of hardware power to add modules/blades if you want to use the features. Easy central management and reporting, when you pay for the blades and get past the learning curve. License renewals are a HUGE pain, but most of their sales reps and partners are cool. Good support.\n\nMy personal preference and experience is to recommend an external facing firewall from Check Point if you can afford the budget, and Fortinet if you can't. I actually like ASAs for other things like internal or east-west traffic monitoring. I personally do not like Palo Alto.",

As a result, we are fortunate(?) enough to use Check Point, Juniper, and Palo Alto.\n\nJuniper/JunOS has a pretty steep learning curve, but once you learn it, for straight-up networking and policy-based firewall, I have found it to be the most effective/best to use *by far*. As others have mentioned, the CLI is heavily scriptable (load set config.txt) and auditable, and you have the ability to roll back your changes automatically if you fuck up. Somebody did mention this and I will agree, there is not a good client VPN solution for Juniper.\n\nCheck Point does a good job of being a firewall/filter but I don't like anything else it does. The current interface feels extremely dated and requires a fat client that only runs on Windows, which means there is no way to configure the policy in the CLI, which means it's not scriptable. Their support is *terrible.* Your support interaction will be, more-or-less:\n\nMe: \"I'm having this problem,\" \nSupport: \"OK, please reference this kb article\" \nMe: \"OK this doesn't apply to my problem\" \nSupport: \"OK please send me a debug.\" \nMe: \"Here is your debug.\" \nSupport: \"I dunno I have to escalate. I may or may not have an answer for you at some point.\"\n\nWe have enjoyed using the Palo Altos so far, they seem to do a good job at the networking and the firewall piece. We have multiple sites, and Palo Alto makes it *very* easy to standardize your configuration across sites, so it's a boon for us. Palo Alto's documentation/support KB is also excellent.",

The reason the first part matters is that some vendors do not disclose internally discovered vulnerabilities and silently patch them. This means customers could be running unpatched firmware without realising they are vulnerable. Certain vendors are worse than others for that. Fortinet has a transparent disclosure policy and an aggressive PSIRT team, which leads them to discovering most of their own vulnerabilities (up to 85% is claimed). The second matters… well because of debacles like the recent PANW vulnerability.\n\nEnd of the day, make your own decision.

Hiding things definitely doesn't lead to better outcomes.\n\nThe more aggressive a vendor is in reviewing their own code for vulnerabilities, the more they will find. If they are finding the vulnerabilities, then fixing them and disclosing them, why is that bad?! I **want** all the vendors to be transparent. If vendors aren't looking at their code, they aren't finding their vulnerabilities, which means bad actors might. If they aren't disclosing the ones they do find, then it leaves their customers vulnerable because they have no idea that they need to patch it.\n\nThe real problem isn't disclosing vulnerabilities, as long as there's a patch or workaround (that works) available, It's the people who either don't patch or apply the workarounds because they're not keeping up with their cyber security, or are unable to. Getting people to patch their stuff is probably one of the biggest challenges in cyber security aside from asset management.",

They both do it, and they both sometimes fail to find, disclose properly,  and fix issues.  They both have tech support that wildly varies based on who you get on the ticket, with an overall not great result.  \n\nOverall, the balance of vulnerabilities very heavily falls on Fortinet, and if you include bugs, it becomes overwhelmingly on them.  \n\nI understand that they have many more products, but that really doesn't make as much difference as you think.  A large portion of Fortinet's products share sometimes substantial amounts of code.  You can tell this by the amount of products listed in bugs and CVEs.  They have the same problem as Cisco.\n\nAside from Panorama and their firewalls, much of Palos products don't seem to share all that much code.  Most bugs you see only affect one platform.  \n\nAgain, I love both products, but if you were just to compare Fortinet firewalls to Palo firewalls, the balance of CVEs and especially bugs falls on Fortinet.\n\nIf you really want to knock on Palo, the real thing is price, and how shitty the tech support you get for that price.  \n\nIf I am paying $5k a year for Fortinet and the support isn't great I kind of expect that, but when I am paying enough for the entire salary of a level 2 tech every year and the support is the same, something is fucked.",

        "selftext": "I'm in the planning/research phase and could really use feedback from others.\n\nCurrently our company has about 150 users across 5 different offices: 1 HQ office and 4 branch offices (all less than 100 miles from the HQ office). The branch offices are small (3-10 users). HQ has DIA fiber for internet connection while the branches have business cable. I would describe us as a very traditional perimeter network right now. We have Palo Alto firewalls at each location and each branch office connects back to HQ via site-to-site VPNs. We also have remote workers connecting back to HQ using Global Protect client.\n\nWe currently have several on-prem resources hosted in the HQ office: Active Directory, file shares, and line of business apps (backed by a SQL server). There's also a business intelligence app we use which connects to the SQL server to make us pretty reports for key performance metrics.\n\nLike a lot of companies, we are having more and more people working from home and we are also looking to modernize our business applications (as they are quite old right now). This means updating our warehouse management system and accounting system. This currently looks like we are going to be moving to more SaaS applications and try to eliminate or at least greatly minimize on-prem resources. Also, we recently made the move to Office 365. We've managed to migrate our Exchange server and are now working on moving file shares to Teams/OneDrive. I'd also like to move us off our on-prem PBX (probably to Teams) at some point.\n\nIdeally, I would like to decentralize our network and enable our workers to be able to work from anywhere while having a consistent set of DNS filtering, firewall, antimalware, and CASB policies applied to each user (ideally through a single pane of glass). I'd also like to eliminate as much on-prem hardware as possible. As I mentioned we currently have PA firewalls at each location that are due for upgrades soon and it would be nice to not have to buy beasts of hardware to support all this, but just get something with basic services to get us the internet connection and let the rest be done in the cloud.\n\nOther possibly relevant info: we rely on our WLAN for our warehouse staff to pull orders and we also offer guest WLAN to customers at our offices.\n\nDoes SASE sound like it would be a good fit for us? I'm not even sure if we need the SD-WAN portion of SASE because ideally we'd be eliminating much of the on-prem resources but we may need to keep some around for a period of transition.\n\nAnyone have any experience with SASE vendors that they would recommend? Palo Alto Prisma seems obvious given our current PA footprint, but maybe we should give ZScaler or Cloudflare a look too?\n\nBasically any advice or thoughts you might have based on our current environment and where we'd like to go, I'd really like to hear it. Thank you so much!",

Palo and Fortinet  (which is going to be a lot more cost effective) would be good SASE offerings to take a look at. \n\nToo many orgs feel they need best of breed across the board, mixing and matching disparate SSE and SDWAN solutions can be operational complex and just a PITA. Longer term the market will converge towards single vendor SASE offerings also inclusive of the ZTNA bits, especially in the commercial mid-market space (which aligns well to the company size you’ve described). \n\nHope that helps, feel free to ask additional questions.",

            "body": "Sound suggestion from u/abhishekrayasam.\n\nI would highlight some key differentiators as it relates to the SD-WAN use case between Cato &amp; Netskope. I understood that Netskope has more of a traditional pure play approach to SD-WAN where the last mile optimizations you get from SD-WAN are mostly beneficial for WAN bound traffic. I believe their SD-WAN does not provide the same value or benefits for public internet destinations or SaaS, e.g. you can't do packet loss mitigation (an SD-WAN feature) to MS Teams on Netskope. I'm not sure if Netskope can do NAT persistence either which is really important for real-time applications like MS Teams. NAT persistence would be important if the HQ or branch edge has to failover or fallback between diverse internet carriers (dual. or greater, diverse ISPs is recommended practice for SD-WAN use cases). I also believe their SD-WAN solution is managed through a separate UI (management application) using a different set of policies and doesn't share that context with its SSE offering.\n\nCato provides last mile optimizations in their SD-WAN solution for ALL directions of traffic. That means packet loss mitigation (as an example) for your MS Teams traffic. Because their SD-WAN bookend architecture is from edge appliance to PoP edge, it means that you benefit for NAT persistence whenever there is local branch/HQ link failover/fallback (change in egress IP at the local edge).\n\nWhy is NAT persistence important? If you have to failover from ISP1 to ISP2 during a Phone Call or Video session you don't want your NAT/Egress IP to change. If it does, which is the case of most SD-WAN offerings out there (even the ones offered as part of a SASE solution), it means that the session will drop...or at the very minimum, the session will be severely impacted while the SaaS provider tries to figure out how to splice the new egress IP session back with the old one (RingCentral could do this, but it was take as long as 90 seconds). With Cato, the egress IP doesn't change if the local links sustain failures or degradation, because you're using Cato's egress IP in the Cato Cloud to reach the provider and not the local link egress IP.\n\nIf your strategy is to take Voice/Video to the Cloud then I would say you still have a valid SD-WAN use case for your HQ and branches where users will be located and participating calls. Cato has only a single UI for its entire platform that encompasses SD-WAN and all its network and cloud app security capabilities. Easy button from a deployment, management and maintenance standpoint.\n\nAnother thing to consider on the Remote Access (and general WAN) use case is that Cato has full stack inline ATP (IPS, Antimalware) for ALL traffic (WAN and Internet). I don't believe Netskope can inspect private access traffic (WAN) with Advanced Threat inspection capabilities, so you would likely have to keep your PANs in place (or some other firewall vendor) to handle private WAN inspection. Netskope has a solid answer for ZTNA, but (in my opinion) challenging trust as it relates to endpoint, app and user isn't enough...you need to challenge \"trust\" of the traffic itself (e.g. inspect it with full stack security, SSL decryption, etc.). I believe Netskope only has ATP capabilities for northbound (Internet bound) traffic.\n\nNetskope is solid (maybe the best?) on Cloud App Security. They have the most comprehensive catalog for Cloud App Security controls. This might be a bigger consideration as you move to more of a SaaS environment going forward, but it's important to qualify your needs against the vastness of their capabilities. You might not need all they have and another provider, like Cato, could have more than adequate coverage for your organization.\n\nBoth Netskope and Cato have large global cloud footprints, but that's probably less relevant with the scope discussed here which seems to be pretty hyper regional.\n\nAgain, as u/abhishekrayasam mentioned, a PoC is great way to validate what you need between the two technologies (or others). Takes the guessing (or taking someone's word for it) out of the equation.\n\nIf it wasn't clear, I definitely have some Cato bias, but Netskope is an excellent technology, too.",

We determined Palo Alto was too expensive, and FortiGates were right in budget range, even with the FortiSASE product.\n\n  \nHowever, we have an Aryaka from our main DC to secondary DC via SD-WAN, Fully managed by them. its been a great product and never had issues. Someone from our team introduced Aryaka to our project, and they apparently have full (Subscription based as it seems) Firewall solution.\n\n  \nI know nothing about Aryaka as far as Firewall capabilities go, and i'm wondering if anyone has any experience with their solution.\n\nWe run a SaaS out of our organization through HTTPs, so security is a concern for us, as well as performance. This is why i was leaning toward PA and Forti. We also have around 16 branch offices, that we want interconnected, so Forti was a very strong contender for this with their SDWAN capabilities in their firewalls, with FortiSASE. ",

They aren't immune though, Palo has had their share recently, Ivanti, etc. The only solution is removing that risk from your network and offloading it to a vendor. That's what SASE achieves. Per Gartner, the top players in this space are Palo, Cato Networks, and Netskope. Since you're already running Fortinet, Palo is probably out as an option. Both Cato and Netskope can integrate quite well with your existing Fortinet lineup.

So in response to that my question is do people still feel the same about their chosen vendor?\n\nThere was a lot of positives and love for Cato which is understandable, it is a brilliant platform. But I have also been lucky enough to try the Zscaler new UI console and feel the same. So given focus on SSE would you still stick with your suggestion even though SD-WAN is not in the cards?\n\nI've done my own research using my own data driven testing and research into the company and technologies (Gartner, GigaOm, Peer-spot) and have come to my own conclusion but I will leave that out to not sway results as I want opinion of practitioners who use it day to day or even consultants who sell  or support both.\n\nI'll make it simpler, if they cost the same and it was just SSE which would you go for and why, go in technical detail if you want to regarding differentiating capabilities.\n\nP.s. promise last question and opinion on this, I just find people on reddit better to give opinions of technologies like this\n\nThank you :)",

            "body": "Between the two, even though it won't likely come out as such with the Analysts you mentioned, Cato is the better solution IMO. Better overall security efficacy, better security strategy, faster to innovate and adapt to market changes (single code base) due to its architecture, full-service symmetry in all its PoPs, etc. \n\nZscaler is now fighting for its position at the SASE table, after having missed the MQ 2 years in a row. Think of what that does to divert engineering and R&amp;D efforts on the security side of the house. They operate multiple code bases and products which have a material impact on their speed of innovation and agility....and support. \n\nThat being said, the analysts are going to represent Zscaler as a more mature SSE solution in the market. I can think of 2 specific reasons why Cato's not really on anyone's SSE list:\n\n1. They sell too much SASE. Many of their customers (maybe most?) have their SD-WAN as well, so they are getting full stack SASE credit....which is why they are so high in the SASE MQ, GigaOm reports, Forest Waves, etc. True SSE, as the analysts count, does not include SD-WAN. That means Cato doesn't get SSE credit for all those SASE (which includes SSE) wins they have.\n\n2. From what I last heard, Cato didn't even register or respond to the SSE RFI/RFP from Gartner...maybe others? Hard to make the board if you're not even trying to get on it. Some think that SSE will eventually go away in favor of simply characterizing it all as SASE....another reason why Zscaler might be making so much effort and investment to get on the SASE board somewhere and why Cato probably doesn't care about spending the time and money to get on the SSE board. \n\nIn the end, SSE is a part of SASE. If you can deliver SASE, you can deliver SSE as well. If you're a leader in SASE, it would make logical sense to be an SSE leader as well...but logic doesn't always win with the analysts in the end.",

Some of the issues I've run across with just their firewall and endpoint solutions (I've only had their products a couple years ladies and gentlemen):\n\nMonths to fix multiple major performance bugs with the endpoint client loaded at all (literally brought computers to their knees just by having the endpoint software running at all... then once that was fixed it took months longer to fix performance issues when using a network file server)....  MFA circumvention just by capitalizing a  letter in the username.... Nonsensical error messages (\"could not connect, the user might login in another computer\"... kid you not this was a real error message)....  IPv4 Rules  act one way for normal firewall operations and a different way for SSL VPN  connections....   Android apps that don't support the latest version of  Android 8+ months after the OS release....  8 months between Android app  updates...  The crappiness of the software goes all the way down to the Android apps - No app switching support on Android (so if I switch out of  the app I have to go back to the app drawer to get back to the app,  which is a big pain for MFA, and FortiToken also has this issue, so then I have to go back to the home screen again and open forticlient vpn when  literally every other app I've ever used including the SonicWall VPN I  can just flick across the bottom of the screen to get back to the app). It's almost like everything to do with FortiNet is broken, doesn't work as expected, or at the  very least defies logic.  We are barely tapping the FortiNet, and feels like the SonicWalls just work and it feels like FortiNet has been one catastrophe, annoying issue, etc.,  after another.  \n\nI gravely regret the mistake I made moving away from SonicWall and to Fortinet.  I wish I could just undo it and go back to Sonicwall, but I don't think the boss would appreciate another $25K firewall just two years after the last one.  \n\n\nTL;DR Fortinet purchase is the worst mistake I ever made.  I spend FAR too much of my time now troubleshooting Fortinet issue after Fortinet issue.  Save yourselves, look elsewhere for firewall and security needs.",

When compared to the other big one, which is PA, both of them are capable with each having its pros and cons. Highly depends on your use case. PA's app-id is much more polished than Fortinet's implementation, their GP RAVPN solution is also ahead of Fortinet's, but Fortinet beats PA in firewall-level SD-WAN solutions and pricing. Feature-wise, both offer similar level of them, with Fortinet being ahead of PA when it comes to literally almost everything other than firewalls. Panorama for PA FW management is, IMHO, a much better product than FortiManager. If you're not investing into SASE solutions, you won't have any benefits from Prisma Access, and if you just want to do simple SD-WAN between different sites, then Fortinet is much better there.\n\nWith that said, I would not be going a full Fortinet stack unless you really really want to do it. The reason why I'm saying this is simple - the further you go down that road, the harder it will be in the future to get out of it. And I do suspect that it will happen at some point - whether it's financing/price related, whether it's that something better came along, it is bound to happen.\n\nFor that reason, I tend to go multivendor whenever I can. Yes, it may be a little bit more convoluted to get everything set up, but at least you don't have to worry about one product screwing everything else. In my experience, a lot of clients are doing just that lately, with most of them choosing \\[PA/Fortinet\\] for firewalls, \\[Cisco/Aruba\\] for LAN and \\[Aruba/Cisco\\] for WiFi/WLAN. It used to be a lot of Meraki for LAN and WLAN, but not so much lately - during early COVID time, it was almost exclusively Meraki, most likely because they were available in warehouses :)\n\nAt the moment, I believe that PA is outrageously expensive, especially when it comes to contract renewals (that's why I always suggest to my clients to go with as many years as they can afford during initial purchase), and it may very well happen at some point with Fortinet. If you have a full stack of their equipment, just imagine what will happen with renewals for all of them - it's not a guarantee it will happen, but it is highly likely.\n\nAlso, at the moment, unless you have a dedicated SME engineer for your contract with Palo Alto who can jump in whenever you need them, Fortinet's support is better. Of course, there are other companies that offer PA support, whether as partners or as MSPs, but you have to do your homework when looking into that.",

Fortinet has lower list prices and lower discount %. Kind of limits their ability to gouge the renewal. Not definitive reasoning, but that's my theory.",

When I did a bake off of Fortinet vs. PA about 10 years ago FortiManager seemed way behind the look/feel of the CLI on the firewalls themselves.  It seemed like the UI was much more polished on the FW themselves.  We also kept on running into weird issues pushing policy as well.  This was around the time where you had the option of writing legacy rules vs. NGFW rules in Fortinet.\n\nPanorama on the other hand worked perfectly and it's 1:1 with the individual firewalls since they are based both on the same underlying OS.  At the time it seemed way more polished and didn't seem to have any legacy-itis.  Making a firewall policy seemed a lot more intuitive as well.",

Most of my deployments are on Fortigates where, once I'm done, they get joined to FortiManager, but as I said, most of the initial config is done directly on the firewalls. \n\nYes, I agree about the interface as well. Once you get a hang of device groups and templates and hierarchy on how everything is set up, it becomes easy to manage. I still do, sometimes, get lost in Panorama when I'm looking for something specific or trying to identify where something is defined, but it just takes a little bit of time to familiarise myself and then I'm golden. Not so much with FortiManager.\n\nOnce again, FortiManager is also a good product, I just prefer Panorama.\n\nRegarding the policies, security, NAT, decryption, etc., I just find them more logical on Palo Alto. Most likely because all of the training I've had ingrained in me the logic of Palo Alto so it's hard for me to think differently from that. Nothing that a little time spent with Fortigates can't fix, but that's just my experience. I also like the object-oriented configuration of Palo Alto, where I can configure different pieces of the puzzle and then combine them all in the final service. One thing I also forgot to mention is the configuration of IPSec tunnels - I just like the way PA does them much better than what you have to do in Fortinet - not that it's bad, it's just much clearer in PA.",

I think you nailed the strengths of each as well - App-ID and GlobalProtect vs SD-WAN and performance/$.   \n\nFrom the support perspective, in my experience Palo has gotten worse over the years. Right now, Fortinet is much more responsive and has better follow-up. Palo is mediocre on both of those metrics. However, when it comes to having a satisfactory resolution, particularly when dealing with App based policy or bugs - Palo is better. I’ve had multiple cases of incorrectly identified apps, or unexpected behaviour, and Forti’s response has been vague at best. I had an agent tell me that since a remote host had multiple PTR records, it was “normal” for it to be detected as different apps, depending on which PTR the firewall chose that time? What?",

If it someone who has no real-world experience and literally finished university/college, got some certs and started working as 'security engineer' at vendor's support team, you will get answers like yours. I'm a little bit older and I still remember old times when security engineering was an evolution and a path seasoned engineers chose after spending years in network engineering. Nowadays security engineering seems to be a path that gets chosen from the start, without previous experience, and that is then reflected in the expertise, or lack of, of the engineers that are providing us support.

I can't give out the exact numbers because of confidentiality agreements with Fortinet. But I can tell you that the price of renewal is just over half of the hardware price alone.\n\nThe numbers do match up. And they make sense. I have no idea if it is typical because I normally work with the mid-range units and lower, though it is roughly just over half the price for the licensing on low to mid range models. So maybe it is typical? One thing I can tell you that Fortinet is worth the money if reliability, ease of use, and community support is important to you.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want an independent Fortinet consultant (I'm an MSP) to run these kind of questions by, send me a PM/chat message.

Second, they provide exposure to various subdomains within the broad field of information technology. I have pivoted several times throughout my career—often based on interests that were peaked while studying for an exam. \n\nWith that said, experience will almost always trump certifications (unless you are working in a highly regulated industry where certain certifications are required—e.g., DoD). The good news is that you can gain experience easily enough by taking advantage of the many available resources. TryHackMe, for example, is a great platform to gain hands on experience with various cybersecurity tools, methodologies, and specialties. I’ve even used my experience with tools on TryHackMe labs to inform decision making processes at work regarding our cyber stack—I.e., if I can put a bunch of people through a TryHackMe course to learn the basics on a tool for relatively cheap, I will opt for that tool over an equally capable tool with less accessible training. Plus, it will be easier to find future employees with relevant experience because TryHackMe is so widely available. \n\nBottom line, pursue certs and use the resources available to you to gain relevant experience.

Scalability, agility, and cost-efficiency are just some of the benefits that have driven widespread cloud adoption. As organizations increasingly rely on cloud computing, the need for secure cloud environments has never been greater. Cyber threats are evolving, and data breaches can have devastating consequences for businesses. As a result, companies are prioritizing security skills when hiring IT professionals. \n\nIT professionals who possess both cloud and security skills offer a powerful combination for organizations. Here's why: \n\n* Efficiency: Cloud security expertise allows professionals to automate security tasks, streamlining operations and reducing manual efforts. \n* Reduced Risk: Understanding security threats and mitigation strategies minimizes the risk of data breaches and cyberattacks. \n* Compliance: Proficient cloud security professionals can ensure cloud deployments adhere to relevant security regulations and compliance standards. \n* Cost Savings: Proactive security measures prevent costly downtime and data breaches, leading to long-term cost savings for organizations.  ",

            "body": "This gets a little confusing because it’s filled with marketing buzz words.  The best way to explain it there’s two different “levels” of the solution: “SSE” is your basic cloud-based VPN.. think zscaler.  Your users tunnel to the vendor’s pop, and then you have on prem connectors that tunnel to the vendor pop, and users can access the on prem resources via these tunnels.  May or may not include a secure web proxy for Internet traffic that’s not going to your on-prem environment.  (And if it does include it, it’ll be an additional license and cost.)\n\nThe other “level” of this solution is “true SASE,” which will combine the above SSE solution with an SD-WAN solution, so your entire fabric is integrated together.\n\nNow it gets confusing and fuzzy because I’ve seen pretty much every vendor calls their solution SASE, whether they have anything on the SD-WAN side or not, because that’s the term most people recognize and what most customers are looking for is “SASE.”  So the term has kind of blurred to basically just mean any cloud based vpn solution.\n\nHope this helps.  Both Palo and Fortinet solutions can integrate with the hardware devices those companies sell, making it a true “SASE” solution by Gartner’s definition.  They offer the ability to directly integrate with your on prem firewalls either as part of the SD-WAN fabric or as manually configured IPSEC tunnels, etc.\n\nMost of the non-SDWAN SASE/SSE vendors offer a light weight Linux/docker vm as the on-prem connector piece.",

SASE should also be a Cloud byproduct. \n\nHow do you get the above with Palo? With Fortinet?\n\nPalo SASE is:\nCloudgenix at the edge for SDWAN. If you want edge security for WAN, you have to then add Palo Strata (NGFW, flagship product). If you want Zero Trust, remote access or Internet Security for your endpoints, you have to add Palo Prisma Access. Btw, if you want the full stack of security through Prisma Access you have pay a significance performance toll. Their security services are not distributed everywhere in their PoPs. You have URLF in some PoPs, Cloud App Sec in other PoPs, ADEM in different PoPs. Etc. Of course, if you buy Prisma Access youre also having to buy Cortex for central logging. They market having over 100 \"edge locations\" but only 30+ service locations/PoPs. The \"edge\" locations don't actually deliver a value. They are just there for marketing embellishment. They sell it like the edge location is optimizing your route to the service location by reducing hops, etc...but you're still sometimes going waybout of the way to get to the service location for inspection before on to your final destination. \n\nFortinet...even worse. To build SASE you have about 10 different products and SKUs and there are all sorts of limits like only being able to have 4 hub locations, for example. They don't have any real Cloud. The Opaq acquisition basically got vaporized, which was their only real aspect of Cloud. \n\nThese suppliers may be single vendor SASE, but they don't really deliver on the values of SASE. They don't actually fix real business challenges when it comes to reducing operational complexity to improve security.",

Others have acquired tech to try and fill the gaps to \"catch up\" as well. Netskope purchased Infiot. Zscaler fought against SDWAN for quite some time, basically saying it wasn't needed at all.

Of the 47 accounts I have that use VMware, I would say 46 are somewhat or very unhappy with all the recent changes. \n\nLiterally all 46 of them are now considering other options, even if VMware had been a long-standing strategic technology for those organizations. \n\nSo I’m curious - is anyone seeing little or no change in their pricing? Happy with some of the new bundles? \n\nI guess what I’m wondering is - have rhey made anyone happy with these changes or is it literally just 99% anger and 1% kinda don’t care?",

I think I had 1.1 installed, tried 1.2 and even got an early release of 1.3 because it was having trouble working with our Red Hat Linux server running LILO.\nBack then, VMware didn't even charge me for the hypervisor. They just wanted to get it out in the wild, and we had some crazy configurations that they really wanted us to convert. Unfortunately it didn't work at that time, and we didn't touch it until version 4.1 again lol.\nWhile the hypervisor has been a product for a while, the company had other projects that they were working on. Enterprise serious company, with a mischievous enthusiastic project side. Broadcom nixed all of those, fired all people, closed divisions, and most likely will re package all the half worked projects into a company and sell them.\nThey will keep updating ESXi and VCenter, maybe implement some changes, but it will be slow.\nIt is not just pricing that changed. And pricing started changing before it was sold (but I believe there were already talks of Broadcom buying it.\nWe saw 2 price increase, our last purchase (we added a new cluster, so we needed more licenses) and another for the renewal that is coming this year.\nBig enterprise will be able to negotiate and will see a 5 to 10% increase (in the form of a 20 to 25% discount). However that discount will not exist in 3 years",

Their large captive customers will pay the massively inflated costs because they're in complete thrall and the massively increased pricing will more than cover the small and medium sized customers that jump ship.

From what I hear from contacts that are still working at VMware, it sounds like a lot of the changes and investments being made internally will likely have a positive impact on product quality, support quality, product capabilities, etc. As an IT consultant that works with primarily very large enterprises, I also am not really concerned about loss of business opportunities that will require my vSphere-oriented skillset. vSphere isn't going anywhere in these kinds of environments.\n\nAttitudes among my clients range from concerned (primarily about costs) to somewhat fearful. The only folks I've talked to are actively angry are those with a big stake in EUC products, who want more clarity on what the future holds for WS1, Horizon, etc.\n\nWhile my clients all seem to be at least taking a serious look at alternatives, most of these clients have requirements and use cases that are going to keep a significant portion of their on-premises footprint on vSphere for one reason or another (sunk costs in automation, compatibility with third-party platforms/products, performance, vendor support). I would wager that most will only be reducing vSphere footprint in edge locations by performing consolidation or migration of services that honestly should have been evacuated from edge locations long ago, and some might migrate their Horizon footprint to Azure Virtual Desktop or AWS Workspaces.",

My theory is that the product and lines have just gotten so complex, there are so many scenarios that Support just doesn't know how to handle them. This, in addition to a period before the major cloud vendors, had people blogging about VMware all the time. I mean even as back as 5 years, support was the same but there was an invested community that would help solve issues. Today, I just don't think it's one of those appealing techs, which is a shame because VMWare is miles ahead of its competitors.",

It takes a while for engineers to get off Sev1 cases to work on lower cases.\n\nFor Real Sev1 cases, get in the phone and never leave. You can ask the account team to escalate the case,  but it really just emails the managers to get someone to look at the case. But, really only use this if it is really needed. And get those logs uploaded and see if someone can look at it live with you.\n\nAlso, know what level of support you have, because that can impact the speed you get replies. \n\nAlso, open a case for each issue.

An hour turned in to 7 at which point I went home from the DC having quasi-stabilized the situation (*albeit broken HA state*). I took to Reddit for advice (*and got it!!!*) and had everything back up in HA Sunday afternoon. Left the ticket idle at this point just curious how long it’d be for a call-back without intervention. (*I DID leave several notes on the ticket during this time though.*) Monday night I get an apologetic call from a manager saying the ticket “got lost in the queue”. Now **how** this happens? Your guess is as good as mine. Could I have called back and pressed an agent? Probably, yup. I would have had it not been for Redditors being so awesome to a stranger.",

We have had two major incidents in the last 4 months that have resulted in loss of service for our customers.  One of the incidents actually took 4 hours to get a tac engineer on the phone, and then 6 hours and additional engineers later they recommended a bugfix that wasnt even published.  We have had several other incidents over the last 18 months and it has been a huge problem getting someone competent on the phone.  We have been very transparent with our Palo sales team and they have done all they can.\n\nWe manage a 60000 node network spanning 4 states and 8 datacenters.  We have around 400 firewalls split between Cisco Firepower 9300 and 4100 series and Palo 400 and 5200 series hardware.  Due to the support problems we have had we have recently started moving away from Palo.  It was an unfortunate decision because while the later Firepower releases are pretty good, Palo is still much better.  Our management just can't stomach the bad support and we have never had a problem reaching a Cisco TAC engineer during a critical incident.  It seems that Palo has hit critical mass after all of the recent acquisitions and their support has taken a back seat to the development of new solutions.  It's really a shame.",

For the sake of this discussion let's make the statement that all vendors check all basic requirements for both internet and private access.\n\nWhat I would like to get your opinions/thoughts/feedback on is on the high level architectural differences, **specifically related to private app access.**  And what those differences mean to Zero Trust - whatever the definition of the day is for ZTNA...\n\n\\- Palo Alto / Cato: coming from a more classic networking background, using hardware devices to build ISPEC tunnels back to their cloud environments, maintaining IP to IP connectivity between client and server.\n\n\\- Netskope / Zscaler: coming form a cloud native background (CASB/SWG), using \"connector\" virtual appliances, being an in-line proxy between client-server and thus breaking IP to IP connectivity between client and server.\n\nI'm having a hard time deciding whether or not the \"proxy\" behavior of the latter is a good or a bad thing.  For example:\n\nI can see the security benefits of proxying every single connection, and thus being able to do authentication/authorization on each flow.  However, you loose all visibility on the server side as all clients are hidden behind the IP of the connector appliance.  \n\nI see the benefit of being able to just deploying an additional connector VM for scalability or in new environments, versus buying more hardware and configuring &amp; maintaining those devices and VPN tunnels.  However, do you want to be dependent on your VM environment for network access?\n\nI see the benefit of being able to prevent cloud backhauling when a user is on-prem via the local connector VMs, versus trying to maintain a consistent policy across cloud and on-prem firewalls.  But again you build more dependencies on your VM environment, and you loose NGFW security capabilities.",

Not sure why companies like Netskope and Zscaler put so much stock into IP obfuscation. The outcome isn't any different if you're remote users are on a dedicated IP pool and have to pass through inspection and control layers before access is granted to a resource. Note, with ZTNA from Netskope and Zscaler they actually trust the traffic once endpoint, user and app are permitted. That's not ZeroTrust to me. I still want that permitted user, endpoint, application traffic inspected by ATP engines. That's a miss on their part and security risk to the customer. All their work to remove network identifiers from the equation is immediately devalued by them not actually inspecting the traffic.",

The different approaches definitely have their pros and cons and tradeoffs, which may not be apparent even during proof of concept testing. I would suggest taking one step back and defining the business goals -- what exactly are you trying to accomplish and where is your current solution falling short?\n\nPersonally I like the idea of removing IP connectivity between clients, but this would have required implementing workarounds for various workflows. I'm not convinced we would have been able to decommission our 'traditional VPN' had we gone this route.  Vendors claim you can get rid of inbound connectivity, and while maybe that would have been true for private application access, we still would have had many systems accessible over the Internet in DMZs behind firewalls.  The VPN gateways themselves aren't my biggest concern since we patch them quickly when new vulnerabilities are announced.\n\nTwo big factors for us were cost difference between solutions and potential overhead of an additional platform to support since we wouldn't be able to eliminate our existing on-prem firewalls.  Ultimately we conducted multiple proof of concepts but stuck with our existing firewall vendor. I didn't feel like our incumbent vendor was necessarily the best in the market at the time, but they were more cost effective, the roadmap looked promising, we could migrate to SSE over time while leaving the VPN solution in place, and it allowed us to maintain a single platform for all network-based security, remote access, and Internet filtering.  We're a couple years in now and I have no doubt this was the best solution for us.\n\nIn short, I recommend to ignore the marketing hype and determine what you are trying to accomplish with SSE. Make a short list of vendors that you believe can accomplish that and start testing them out. A vendor that's a great fit for one organization may not be a good for another.",

They don't control the \"cloud\" itself and are beholden to GCP and AWS. Their \"cloud\" is also quite inconsistent in terms of what services you get from various service locations. This is to be expected from all the acquisitions they've undergone.  Also, if you were to go full stack with PANW, it's quite complicated and can be quite expensive as well.\n\nCato is cloud-native, similar to Netskope &amp; Zscaler in terms of the generic definition of cloud-native, but a lot different in terms of architecture. Cato sits in between the Palo's and Zscaler/Netskopes of the world with a cloud-native solution but a traditional inline/transparent proxy architecture. When you think \"inspection\" Cato gives you full stack inspection (Advanced Threat Protection) of all ports and protocols where Zscaler/Netskopes reverse/forward proxy architectures doesn't actually deliver that full stack inspection of all ports and protos. They claim they do, but it's really just from an access perspective, e.g. allow/block protocol, unless it's a certain protocol like HTTP, DNS or FTP (maybe others?). Also, the onramp to Cato SSE can be IPSec from an existing edge appliance, and endpoint agent or even via private L2 links in markets where their PoPs reside. Of course, they have their SD-WAN appliance (for full SASE), but that's not what this post is about.\n\nWith the cloud-native providers, there is also the prospect of optimized user experience through network optimization. With Netskope/Zscaler, the story is pretty much the same. They colocate in relevant markets (PoPs) and peer with a pretty extensive catalog of IX's. This often results is a cleaner, more optimal onramp from the site/user and egress to the public SaaS. This doesn't really apply at all to their private access solutions (ZTNA) since those solutions are pretty much 100% public internet overlay technologies. With Cato, it's a bit different. They also colocate in relevant markets and peer with IX's, but their PoPs performs TCP acceleration through proxy'ing and they actually connect all their PoPs together in full mesh to create a global optimized backbone (think in terms of MPLS and creating a predictable experience). This benefit extends to any edge connection, e.g. mobile/remote user, site, datacenter, etc.\n\nIn summary, definitely architectural differences in these suppliers in terms of both how they proxy/inspect to address network SECURITY use cases but also how the proxy to improve overall network performance/user experience.",

You have to pay for each pop, and the per user cost of comparable options is 20-30 bucks less per user per year. You also have to pay for connectivity to your on premises dc. I haven’t had the best support experience from then ether. We’re not renewing. I am big fan of the sdwan and NGFW products.\n\n\nIf you’re looking at private access I suggest looking at zScaler and Cloudflare. These two had the best overall test results and support both client and client less access. Zscaler was more feature rich while Cloudflare offered the best user experience and performance. The best thing about the proxy approach is that your public attack surface decreases, and you can also easily deploy proxies close to the applications.

Again, you can do that with regular firewall rules behind your vpn gateway.\n\nReduce attack surface of vpn users?  Again you can do this with pretty much every traditional vpn solution you can operate in nat overload mode, and make it look just like a SSE vpn, you can operate in pool mode and assign a unique IP to each new user.  \n\nWe’re just not seeing what actual benefits SSE introduces.  The only advantage I can think of is you’re offloading management of the actual vpn gateway and client connectivity to the vendor, so no inbound firewall rules in your dmz, no maintaining client certs and server cert, no late night emergency security patching of the vpn gateway appliance, etc.  But you can already get all those benefits if you just outsource your vpn solution to an MSP.\n\nI’m convinced SSE/ZTNA products are pure marketing fluff.

For us, they didn't scan their tenant URI; they scanned the landing page of the public company website.  Why?  Beats the heck out of me but I digress.\n\nMy company's public website has port 80 open.  For some fucking reason, it doesn't matter to SecurityScorecard that there's an automatic redirect to 443 and connections are not accepted on port 80.\n\nBut the fucking SecurityScorecard report says that despite they measure over 100 different areas of application security it gives us an 'F' for appsec with a big red banner across the top of the page because of that one, singular, port 80 finding -- which again, isn't even a thing.\n\nIn turn customers then come to us (and me as the leader of the security function in the company) and make all kinds of wild ass accusations that in allowing this vulnerability we're in breach of agreement, that they want to audit us, that they are going to contact regulators, that they are going to open a CVE against our use of port 80, yada yada yada.\n\nIt becomes a huge time suck to respond to these things and especially when the public gets all lathered up over nothingburgers because the SecurityScorecard report is structured in such a way that it reads like the sky is falling.  With SecurityScorecard I basically have an external auditor that I didn't hire, I don't know who they are (SecurityScorecard has a page to submit false positives, but they don't respond) they don't work for me, but somehow I have to work for them.",

I should mention this was academic pricing. I asked my normal reseller to requote 3 years of perpetual licenses with (SNS) support. The new quote as of 1/16/24  came back at 52k. I currently have licenses and support till 2026. So I'm ok for now. There's some wired tention on the phone when I spoke to my new Broadcom rep. Broadcom wouldn't do a renewal based on my current license because \"They are unable to offer to extend them further at this time.\"  So they sent my VAR pricing for a initial buy in.  When asked about more information on it they basically said this is what we are offering.  So as of right now I have to take it with a grain of salt and prepare as if my pricing is going to go up 625% in a couple years.",

So I hope that indeed they just hired a batch of very junior profiles to fortify support and that once these get a bit of knowledge and they stay (the junior I had on one (confirmed only started working  1  year ago) ticket seemed to be openly question me if there were any open positions in our company and if they allow remote work...) they will indeed vastly improve support.

Cisco has ALWAYS baked in discount from list pricing for the entire reason that they have a very deep partner network and have to keep them to drive their business. Those deep discounts become partner levels and thus continue the entire behavior. Cisco is also one of the most horrible on list price for that reason. \n\nAlso, as a longtime user of Cisco's gear, both as a pre and post sales engineer as well as a longtime customer after my stint at a reseller, please reconsider another vendor for security. Cisco hasn't had a lot of change going on there in the positive, they also lost their lead for security (for probably good reasons) and so need a bit to show their path forward afterward. Not to mention, pop into the Cisco and other reddits here for true thoughts on Cisco security products and it's ... not good. That's on them. Feel free to buy and work with whomever you want but there are other good vendors out there, even if you don't go with Palo Alto.",

            "body": "I do agree with you that Fortinet has been having some issues the last 1,5 year. Mostly has to do that they were trying to enter the enterprise market with really competitive pricing/licensing. This has caused that the company has been growing way to fast. However stating that they should be treated as fragile and unstable is a bit much. Getting in contact with support is easy/fast. However if you're hitting a bug than development can take quite some time. Bugs will be added to the known bugs in the release notes.\n\nFrom what I have seen people are way to keen on updating their FortiGate firewall with the latest patch or even the latest train. Without needing any of the new/additional features. It doesn't matter which product/vendor you are using. Running bleeding edge software is never a good idea. Also the reason why Fortinet created the page  \n[https://community.fortinet.com/t5/FortiGate/Technical-Tip-Recommended-Release-for-FortiOS/ta-p/227178](https://community.fortinet.com/t5/FortiGate/Technical-Tip-Recommended-Release-for-FortiOS/ta-p/227178) Or deploying updates without proper testing.\n\nWe have about 750 FortiGates in the field and haven't had that many issue with them.  Used them since FOS 5.6 with multiple setups (DPI/Proxy/Central-NAT/SD-WAN/Dual Hub SD-Branch/...)\n\nThe critical vulnerabilities you've mentioned are mostly discovered by their own internal PST. With already a patch/bugfix available the same day/week. Without there being a known exploit available. Yes, announcing this vulnerability does require the network engineers immediate patching. But I would rather have a company be open about possible vulnerabilities than not knowing.\n\nAgreed the anycast implementation has been lacking. We always roll out the \"old\" option  \n[https://community.fortinet.com/t5/FortiGate/Technical-Tip-FortiGuard-is-not-reachable-via-Anycast-default/ta-p/190041](https://community.fortinet.com/t5/FortiGate/Technical-Tip-FortiGuard-is-not-reachable-via-Anycast-default/ta-p/190041)   \nwe also use other DNS servers not the Fortinet own servers.\n\nSaying that for example Palo doesn't have their own issues (CVE-2024-5910). But still \"you pay for what you get\". Palo really has a great support/product. However is alot more expensive than Fortinet. When choosing between both Fortinet and other vendors they mostly are the way to go.",

        "selftext": "Our current stack requires a Meraki Firewall with all of the advanced security licensing as part of the site build. We have all of the usual suspect tooling like spam filtering, mdr w SOC, RMM, SIEM with log shippers, and otherwise. Many of our customers do not have any onsite resources like servers or nas storage, making the user-initiated VPN unnecessary to do their daily work via SaaS applications and the like while remote. We have also began picking up customers that have no office presence whatsoever, strictly remote users working from home or shared office spaces we do not control.\n\nHere’s where I’m curious and the possibility begins.\n\nIf we were to pickup a SASE/ZTNA toolset, does it make much sense to have a Godzilla firewall at the office when users may or may not connect to it? We would put in an inexpensive network stack, sized to their business requirements, but blanket this technology across every device and create firewall-esque deny all rules in the SASE toolset. It would seem that it now no longer matters where your device goes, your protection is always-on and ready. It also allows us to enforce the security via the always-on vpn style function, something Meraki have - unless maybe you ‘buy’ the Anyconnect licensing. (We’re aware no one actually audits this)\n\nAs an added bonus, it sounds like this will also simplify connectivity to resources no matter where the user is. Removing the setup and maintenance of vpn users, tunnels between sites, etc.\n\nVendors we’re looking into:\nCato Networks\nCloudflare One\nZscaler\nPerimeter 81\nExium\nTimus\nTodyl\n\nSanity check, are the vendors selling us too hard or is it as good as it sounds?",

The zero trust config is easy to setup and tier1 techs are able to navigate without much oversight.\n\nThe bonus for us is todyl is not all or nothing. You can build almost any of their products into a stack. You can have different stacks per client .. outside of their mxdr.\n\nThis let us bring our entire base over with just their edr product and then go out and add more security features and just drag and drop on the stack updates the clients. So ease of use and options were really good for us.\n\nIf you know kql you can make your own alerts on top of what they and the soc team does.. i.e. we track every admin login that's nothing that's going to alert anywhere but a custom kql query gives it to us.\n\nThe one thing that I don't love is the reporting options. They are okay not great and you can only email reports to existing users . In our case we have a report portal for all clients that we like to send reports to so that's made a bit more work for us setting up mail flow rules to filter and fwd those everytime we setup a new client.\n\nHonestly we didn't try anything else we heard good things we evaluated and were happy and just moved forward.\n\nWe do still put a firewall at the edge if there's an office everything in layers. Todyl has a handful of fw logs they will ingest so we stuck within their framework.",

It also randomly decides it can't route Microsoft traffic, just teams is working and suddenly not, then it is.

Intentionally.  \n\nNow this new service offering (dedicated ticket pusher) feels like an almost necessary upgrade to protect our large investment in Cisco infrastructure.  \n\nBoom, a new subscription-service revenue stream is born.  \n\nCisco the software company wants to focus on subscription revenues now as part of their strategic plan, and making basic-TAC suck is a cornerstone of that strategic vision.  \n\n-----  \n\nIt is reasonable to say this, in Cisco's defense:  \n\nThey sure as hell didn't invent this profit model.  \n\n\"Our basic support sucks, try our premium offering.\" is a defacto standard for software companies world-wide.  \n\nIBM, Oracle, Computer Associates and others are way, way more sadistic and evil in this specific area.  \n\nIt's just unfortunate that Cisco leadership is choosing to model their company after those horrific examples.  \n\nBut in this era of \"whatever makes the shareholders happy\" corporate planning, this really shouldn't be all that big of a surprise.",

And now you want your support person to go through all bugs regarding protocol X during the last 4 years?  The issue might have been fixed in a commit/change that wasnt clearly labelled as a bug. Or the bug-description doesnt match the problem you're seeing. Its a lot of work, and it might not be conclusive. So just testing the latest release might be a very practical solution.\n\nBut of course you can always ask.",

        "selftext": "TL/Dr; looking for rankings of firewall/security gateway products.\n\nMy organisation (10k staff users + 4k guest WiFi), is currently running a HA cluster of Checkpoint 13500's. They have served us well, but recently have run out of steam when we have tried to enable Identity Awareness and HTTPS inspection, and are at the end of their life, needing replacement.\n\nIn the last 18 months we have had significant issues with VPNs and Checkpoints implementation of IKEv2 (which an engineer let slip was non standard). Due to the VPN issues, the board have mandated that we consider additional vendors in the replacement tender, despite our teams experience and expertise is all Checkpoint-centric.\n\nAs is understandable, every vendor thinks their product is best, and it's hard to form a proper opinion from presales demos and discussions. So what I'm after is some objective comparisons between the brand's, such as those found at esecurityplanet.com, so that we can get a sense of how they compare to each other, notable benefits/pitfalls that are hard to judge at this stage, so that we can do our diligence and not just take the vendors word for how awesome they are, especially if they score similarly and need tie breakers that I can present as evidence either for or against.\n\nThe vendors that we are looking at are Palo Alto, Fortinet and Checkpoint.\n\nSo far I really like the look of Checkpoint's Maestro system, but concerned about the support we have had recently, and Palo Alto seem to be saying all of the right things that would make management weak at the knees.... But it could just be all presales banter!",

All clear.\n\nI got the second month's bill:\n\nCache Reserve Storage 0.10234 **$0.03**  \nCache Reserve Writes 1,718 **$9.00**  \nCache Reserve Reads 14,975 **$0.72**\n\nAnd here is the question, why do I have to pay $9 for 1,718 writes when the pricing says I should pay $4.5 for every million? Or am I miscalculating somehow?",

Only then, after a month of internal discussions, they admitted that the calculation was incorrect and refunded the corresponding amount.

And the fact that it's always on and you can do posture checking is amazing as well.  You can force logout and force users to reauth if you want to but with posture checking you may not need to to make it seem less to the user.\n\nAs with any product there are gotchas and reading docs are important but I have found Zscaler docs to be amazing.  \n\nDisclaimer: Customer not Shill :)",

Yes, they have published IP ranges, but that's another thing you need to add to all of your SGs.    \n\n\n2) Things like python's pip, docker pull, git,  basically any command line utility that goes out over SSL breaks with the Zscaler because the application thinks theres a man in the middle attack, which let's be honest, is exactly what it does.  You have to add Zscaler certs  to your config files.  We wrote scripts to do this, but its still a pain, and in some cases (like with CDK) it still causes problems.\n\nI will say that in the newer versions, they give you the ability to whitelist certain applications (.exes) on your system, but its still a very painful process that involves the security team, and approvals, etc.",

Even there latest model is using a quad core from 2012. It really depends on your needs though.  The AP's and switches seem to be pretty solid on their own, but firmware updates can be hit and miss. They can be somewhat buggy and they are missing some of the features you'd expect. That said they did just roll out a new version of their firmware that has some additional features, but its related to the firewall. Overall I think of them as SOHO but not much bigger. They are stepping up their game so maybe in a few years.\n\nWe run Meraki now, like all Cisco products they can get costly. Depending on your budget and needs they may be worth using. I have a bit of a love hate with them, especially some of their advanced malware protection. Currently if I enable it my replication breaks. It seems like it's not only me either. They so release new IP addresses to whitelist so their gear can phone home. It would be easier to allow us to approve the whitelist in the dashboard, but we have to add them individually. They have a way to create policy objects, but I've ran into bug there as well. \n\nIf I had to do it all over I'd consider Juniper/Mist. I really liked MIST AP's, and if I went with them I'd also consider Juniper. I don't know if I would go with Juniper switches and firewalls,  UT I'd seriously consider it. They have cloud managed switches and firewalls now, those lines are not as mature as the MIST AP's though. I looked into them maybe a year back and was impressed with them. My boss likes a full stack from a single vendor so a full rip and replace would be a tough sell. \n\nI've not worked with Aruba before so I'd don't have anything to offer there. I used to run Ruckus Unleashed AP's in my house that I liked pretty well. They offer switches as well under brocade, but I never messed with those. I started to, but the thing was a power hog so I used a Ciscl 2960 and the a Ubiquiti POE when I moved over to all Ubiquiti. \n\nHope this helps, it's just my thoughts and experience with different gear, though, so take it with a grain of salt.",

          {
            "body": "SASE is both security and networking. Think of the \"networking\" piece as the onramp method to the Secure cloud. With some SASE suppliers, that onramp traditionally represents both SD-WAN at the branch/datacenter edge and an agent that runs on the endpoint.   \n  \nHow the SASE cloud works is likely to be pretty variable between suppliers. I'll try to summarize to top SASE suppliers based on Gartners analysis in the SASE MQ:\n\n\\- Palo Alto Networks: Didn't really build anything new. They took a number of existing products and technologies through numerous acquisitions and packaged them into SASE. They forged partnerships with GCP and AWS to host some services that were traditionally on prem. It's a very complex solution to deploy and maintain, but they are doing their best to leverage things like AI to consolidate User Interfaces and make operating the solution easier. They may be making headway on the operating side, but it's still very complex to deploy.\n\n\\- Cato Networks: Built their own Cloud platform which delivers SASE. They deploy their network/security software stack in top tier DCs around the globe (e.g. Equinix, CoreSite, etc.). Many say that they were purpose built for SASE even before SASE was a term created by Gartner. They appear to be the most complete solution/platform in terms of what SASE was created to do and deliver down to the enterprise, removing complexity and risk and driving better overall security efficacy through a single shared context that all security services have access to. They are pretty simple to deploy and manage. Maintenance, itself, is 100% covered by Cato. \n\n\\- Netskope: Cloud-native SSE solution. Leading Cloud App Security solution and solid SWG. They have a very mature endpoint solution, but their SD-WAN solution (acquired a few years back - Infiot) doesn't appear to be on the map much. It got great reviews by Gartner, but they don't seem to have too many customers using it yet. At least this is the feedback I often here from enterprises and resellers. I don't personally know how many SD-WAN customers they have.\n\n\\- Fortinet: Somewhat similar to Palo Alto, in that they have lots of different products they are trying bring together (a portfolio) and offer to the enterprise. It's more or less a packaging versus a platform that really solves complexity problems for the enterprise. My impression is that they have a bit of a cloud identity crisis (they have both their own PoPs and also build PoPs with cloud service providers similar to PANW) and building out a SASE solution with them comes with a lot of nuance and exceptions or rules.  \n  \nThere's a lot more to add to all of these suppliers, both pros and cons, of course. Best to get your own 1st hand impression and understand what SASE means to them. The marketing might all feel the same with the same message, but executing their respective solutions could be wildly different from the marketing.",

Sure, it's a data quality issue but other legacy products do a better job to compensate.\n\nFinally, the limited criteria you can use in a DLP policy means that 1 policy in a legacy solution becomes 10 policies in Netskope.\n\n  \nAs an extra, and this might not be an issue for others, I don't like the multiple levels they use and you cannot drill down easily: A policy, uses a profile, that uses rules, that uses entitities... The policy also uses categories that use url lists. Well, when you open a policy, you only see the top objects (e.g. the names of a user group, a category and a profile), you have to browse around outside the policy to see the details so it takes a lot of clicks to understand what a policy does.",

Also DLP which we are interested in was avoided during the first presentation.\n\nThe positives about them I will mention is that troubleshooting connections appears very good.  Dedicated IP addresses included with license.  They have all the features we want on paper but the other places we liked had them as well and do them better.",

Working backwards from a product is saying you have a hammer and are asking what nails you need to hit.\n\nThree primary capabilities you want out of a SASE are as follows:\n\n* CASB/HTTPS inspection proxy: allowing for web filtering, DLP, malware protection, and analytics.\n* ZTNA, as in a network overlay with fine grained access control based on identity and services, as opposed to location or IP ranges.\n* Authenticated Proxies, for allowing remote access via a browser without additional software.\n\nThe first one gets provided by any security focused inspection proxy. Zscaler does a good job. So does most firewall vendors.\n\nThe second one (in my opinion) is actually kinda terrible to try to solve with SASE. Most places I've seen attempt it just end up with a VPN but worse, usually due to the complications involved with using a web proxy to solve a layer 3 problem. Worst case, you end up with a half implemented ZPA and a VPN because you never got it good enough to actually make a switch.\n\nModern VPNs introduce ACLs and/or peer to peer scaling that make the SASE value add non-existent for ZTNA. Tailscale, Zerotier, etc. are very simple to implement and get the job done. Alternatively, SD-Access/SDLAN solutions integrated with a regular VPN will also do the job.\n\nThe third one is becoming a normal commodity, available with pretty much all identity providers. Entra ID, for example, offers an application proxy built into most M365 offerings.",

Features, management, documentation, capabilities, etc, Palo is the standard.  Performance is predictable and meets or exceeds anything in the public spec sheets.  Stability has not been the best lately, but only feels bad compared to the pre-10.2-ish era.\n\nFortinet provides something approaching Palo in terms of the above, though not quite, at a much better price/performance ratio.  We see a lot of Fortinet going into cost sensitive customers who are very happy with it.  Fortinet also has a better story if you’re looking for an all in one solution including non firewall capabilities including SDWAN, switching, IAM, MFA, etc.\n\nCisco’s NGFW offering has always felt like a second rate hacked together solution.  It’s still an ASA backend glued to a Snort engine taking in Talos data feeds, that TAC will disclaim “open source” for anything undesirable that Snort does.  All of this is managed by a feature limited, poorly performing GUI and no CLI capability.  Nobody would buy FTD if it didn’t have Cisco’s name legitimizing it and security EAs tied to it.  The number of issues and quirks you’ll find out the hard way is impossible to understand until you’ve been there.  If you’re a vendor who sells and implements all three solutions, you really see it.\n\nSupport is roughly equally bad across all three vendors these days.",

We use Palo at the boarder, FTD for VPN and departmental access, Meraki for remote offices, and Fortinet at the data center. Each of them have their strengths they all have their own quirks that can cause issues if you are not prepared for them.\n\nFor example, we make heavy use of MineMeld but we started having to be more selective about the fields because we started running into limitations on the amount of IPs that the Palos could store. Limitations that IMO the 5200s should not have.  However, we provide NAT services for Wireless for (as least last Wed) a peak of about 33K users with no issues. We tested out GlobalConnect but we ran into weird issues (for sure most were Operator Error) so that really was not an option for us.\n\nFor VPN, we use AnyConnect from Cisco. Defiantly more complex to setup then other offerings but worth the effort. Between AOVPN (Management Tunnels) and regular users we seem to average about 4200 users a day on the VPN. With an active population of just over 100K users a quick search of Jira tells me that we have had 8 support tickets for the VPN in the last 12 months. However Cisco has some super weird issues (some are fixed in 7.3 but that is not gold yet) just as no OSPF over VTI, no using a loopback for a termination point (even on our 9300s w/SM-56s). But the one thing that is really weird and is a hold-over from the ASA days is no secondary nets on an interface. If you have that anywhere if you go FTD you are going to have to move them to a separate VLAN. Also if you want IDS/IDP then use a dedicated product for that. If you want to use SAML, AD w/Duo integration, it is not a pain to setup at all, sorry GlobalConnect.\n\nSNORT is hit or miss and has weird issues from time to time when upgrading. IMO AppID from Palo while a super pain in the ass when it incorrectly identifies traffic and blocks it (All my Splunk brothers out there with traffic on port 8K will know what I am talking about).\n\nThere is not much to say about Fortinet. They go in, they do the job, we even have small departments using their VPN client. We have more tickets for that than AnyConnect and I think there are only about 80 or 90 users but it is dead simple to setup. In our data center we have a cluster of 3960Es and the just run. We can peak at about 75Gb with little issue. However, if you run Nessus for VS then you are going to want to be careful about how you configure your scans, if you hit the session creation limits for the cluster, you can cause units to perform a fail-over between the nodes. Also if you do anything with SIP make sure you disable the helper or it will help SIP traffic transverse the firewall even with a block rule. Of the three, I think that Fortinet has the easiest to use UI. As others have mentioned the CVEs are fun from time to time but if you go with a layered approach like we did you can avoid most of the fun and get things patched quickly without exposing yourself too much.\n\nOn the branch offices we used to use the Fortinet 60? (Replace the ? with whatever the current version is) but we moved most of them to Meraki. The templated design of Meraki and the SDN features is what prompted our decision. However if you need RAW through-put you would be hard pressed to beat the Fortinets. I know that was fairly long-winded but I hope it helps.  \n\n\nSorry for any grammar, its early and I have not had coffee yet. ;)",

But something seemed off with them to me, felt like the engineers and founders built something great, but with all the capital raising they were getting displaced by the Sales/MBA types, and it was getting very convoluted.\n\nFor instance, you purchase a bandwidth allocation for your socket, but performance was usually well above it. So it not a limit, but the rules around it weren't entirely clear, or I was smart enough to understand it. To me it screamed the Engineers hate artificial caps, but MBA's want built in upsells. Was it just a matter of time before they turned the soft cap into a hard cap and drop us a 20% cost increase? No way to tell so we started calculating based on full available bandwidth at a site rather than expected use, which blew things out.\n\nThen they were always trying to upsell their new AV/EDR solution. No thanks, stick to what you are good at.\n\nWe PoC'd it for a while, but some need-to-have features were on the roadmap for \"next month\", for 6 months. Eventually they gave us an ultimatum to purchase or cease the PoC...no one gives our CIO an ultimatum, and the relationship ended there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still look at the release notes, seems like they are delivering sensible updates at a reasonable cadence.",

Perhaps you're confusing that with the network-based NGAM which inspects payloads for unknown malicious threats as well as signature-based threats in the network stream itself. \n\nThe licensing thing sounds like there might have been confusion. Cato licenses based on bandwidth tiers and there are T&amp;Cs to using the platform. If a customer consumes more than they are licensed for then they would have to consider dialing in their consumption better to stay within license limits or upgrading their bandwidth. Seems pretty practical. \n\nPoCs aren't meant to run forever. They do take resources to run and support so it makes sense that if there was no commitment to proceed commercially that the PoC would have to be shut down.",

I can do either of these on a number of other brands network devices and it's rather cumbersome to deal with in FortiOS.  \n\nVery commons cenarion:  I want to have a DHCP range of .100-.150 for workstations. I want to use DHCP reservations in .50-.55 range for printers, and I do not want .50-.55 to be used for anything but printers.  With MSFT DHCP server (and pretty much any cheapo router on the market) I can simply set my DHCP range for .100-.150 and then add a reservation for .50 and the DHCP server will give out .50 for the reservation, even though it is out of scope.\n\nIn FortOS, I have to define .50-.55 as a DHCP range and make sure I have 5 reservations set.  Lets say I only have 2 printers for now, that means 2 real reservations and 3 dummy reservations with fake mac addresses.  Or I have to change the DHCP range each time I need to add another printer.  One way or another, it's a lot of unnecessary extra work.",

If I have to change something with the tunnel and I don't want to do it in CLI I then to go back to VPN - IPsec Tunnels page to do anything.  \n\nThe IPsec Monitor page basically only shows Incoming and Outgoing data, created time, timeout, and up/down status (there's other info but its NA in my environment).  IPsec - VPN Tunnels also shows you up/down status.  \n\nThis is on a 1700 tunnel hub where not having a filter set on one of those three pages means I have to wait ~5 seconds for any of the above pages to load (6.0.8).

            "body": "I noticed that GUI on a fresh Fortigate 40F takes much longer to load then on the 60F both have comparable hardware so this strikes me as odd. For example the ISDB takes around 8 seconds till its loaded on a 40F while it takes only 1 second on a 60F.\n\nMaybe you could add a option like on the FortiManager to display all CLI only options in the GUI. \n\nIf I upgrade to a new release branche, for example from 6.0.x to 6.2.x it would be awesome if the Fortigate could automaticly switch to the other Boot Partition. This would lower the need to downgrade as you could switch back and forth to the old partition in case its not working as planed. Currently I need to manualy switch the Partition, reboot, update, reboot again. \n\nI personaly like the FortiOS CLI but I wish the inbuilt discription of commands would be better. In most cases the discription is just the Name of the command without abbreviation. The CLI Documentation does not help too much with this issue.\n\nSince I uses the debug commands quite a lot it would be nice if the GUI could include some of the most commonly used debug commands via a new submenu.\n\nSome times FortiOS contains bugs that keep customers from updating it would be greate to have a mechanism that can notify me once a specific BUG ID has been resolved so I know its safe to Update again without constantly checking evey release for a fix that may or may not exists.\n\nAnother thing that could help alot would be a Taskmanager so I can restart processes that use up too much CPU or memory. Maybe even add way so I can limit how much percent of total resources a specific process like IPS or WAD can use. This would allow to remediate situation with memory leaks and conserve mode.\n\nA bit unrelated:\n\ndo you know why the Red Theme was remove in 6.2 and replaced by the Neutrino Theme? Will there ever be a option to use your own Themes?\n\nIs there a reason why I can't supply my own Language? A big part of my Customer speak really bad english. I am positive you could reduce Support Tickets by offering  a Language Template that could then be translated by Partners, Distributors or Customers. \n\nYou Guys do an awesome Job! please ask your Manager to repeat this sentence to you :)",

If you're having performance issues on a particular model, you can send to [reddit-feedback@fortinet.com](mailto:reddit-feedback@fortinet.com) and we'll take a look.\n2. Good suggestion. We have something similar already - a shortcut to take you to the CLI to edit CLI only properties. This will be expanded to more pages in FortiOS.\n3. The CLI descriptions have been improved significantly over the past several years. These are reflected in the CLI guide as well.\n4. Please share the diagnostic commands you use the most often, and in what context.\n5. Interesting suggestion.\n6. The \"Task Manager\" idea is also an interesting idea.\n7. Theming capabilities are in review for a future release.\n8. Custom language support is available for the end user facing components of the GUI (SSL-VPN, and Guest Management). Is that what you are looking for?",

Local user config, allow 2factor options of email and sms. (Fortitoken is whats in there, you need to go cli to set as email or sms)\n\n3.Route-maps, prefix list, acls, advanced routing features for bgp and ospf (including adding monitor features that currently you need cli to query like neighbors)\n\n4. When creating/editing a policy, it'd be nice if a mouse hover over the address object displayed the IP/subnet. (Currently have to go deeper in menus to get it)\n\n5.when looking at traffic, specifically blocked traffic, add improvements and consistancy for why the traffic is blocked. I noticed some threat menus depending on where I'm looking (e.g. monitor,  traffic log, fortiview etc.) the details of the traffic log entry vary in info on why the packet was blocked. \n\n6. Traffic log retention/overwrite,  add option in gui (had to change to longer than 7 days in cli)\n\nMy exp with these is on 6.2.3 \n\nAfter working with palo for a number of years where really everything is in the gui. Its somewhat of an adjustment having to go to hybrid gui/cli. Where im having to go into the cookbook to see if the feature is supported and what the cli syntax is, vs if it was in the gui I'd know its supported and would see what options are there to configure.

Like i mentioned coming from a palo background it seems with fortinet I'm having to jump around, between logging, fortiview and monitoring, sometimes getting better info and other times redundant. Not that i haven't found the info i needed or anything though (its good at providing data). Part of it i just need to get used to. But that and the hybrid gui/cli are really the only things I'd call out. Either way i do like forti so far. HTH",

ZPA Browser Access works for this, but you don't really have much of an ability to enforce device health compliance using it.\n\nInstalling the client connector on non-managed devices was a non-starter for us due to our preference to SSL inspect as much as possible. The only method for selectively disabling inspection was based on user/user group, not the device, so this caused us problems with those folks who insisted on using both a company owned machine and their own device.\n\nBoth of these were ultimately a failure of policy, though. Before you purchase any zero trust access solution like this, you'll want to make sure your existing corporate policies are up to date to make this as smooth as possible.\n\nIf you haven't already, push some policy language in your AUP banning personal device usage. If you're planning to leverage SSL inspection and ZIA, you need to talk with your legal and HR teams about defining what you want to inspect and what you don't. And if you have third parties accessing your systems, you're going to want to account for that in the planning phase.\n\nExecutive/key stakeholder buy-in is also absolutely important. You've stated you're just looking at ZPA, which is fine, but what may happen if/when you start rolling this out is someone's going to Google the term \"Zscaler\" and may well find sensationalized information about it being \"spyware\" or \"corporate snooping.\" Having a firm and consistent dialogue with the folks in power about what the product will and won't do will greatly help.\n\nYou'd also do well to definitively answer the question \"who needs access to what.\" The biggest benefit of ZPA is restricting application/network level access to only the folks who absolutely need it. It's important to not try to figure this out on the fly.",

Instead of properly centralizing all of these various applications, the previous regime ended up just expanding their use to other facilities across the WAN. In effect, most sites could be considered small data centers.\n\nWe had also just recovered from a ransomware attack and the ability to inspect traffic across the WAN was of critical importance.

It's built on wireguard so the policy enforcement point (PEP as defined by NIST in 800-207) is in their cloud. This is both less secure as it is not microsegmenting tunnels with least privilege to the endpoint and forces all the traffic to go through their PoPs, even if you want to apply ZTN to 'east-west' traffic in your LAN (i.e., server-to-server or client-to-server in a branch/site). I don't know how their clientless solution works, cannot find any good docs... but as its wireguard I expect your have to forward traffic to their DCs (i.e., you only have native app encryption and security for first leg)... if you know of good docs on it please share. I also understand Axis only works with DNS addresses and not IP.  \n\n\nThe best implementation of ZTN (I am biased as I work on it) is Ziti. It comes in both free and open source (OpenZiti - [https://github.com/openziti](https://github.com/openziti)) and commercial SaaS (CloudZiti). With Ziti we push policies for intercept/microsegment/host all the way to the endpoint so that we are both as close to the protect surface as possible as well as not require traffic to go out of LAN. Rather than a single tunnel, Ziti provides intercepts per application flow, each potentially routable across completely different overlay path for better performance and policy control. It provides authenticate-before-connect, mTLS and E2E encryption, outbound tunnelling, private DNS (meaning we can intercept IP, DNS, and even traffic that does not comply to TLD), posture checks, microsegmentation, least-privilege, and more. Ziti also has a smart routing mesh overlay network with massive obsfucation. This is for any use case, client-server, server-server, machine-server, etc, client initiated, server-initiated, does not matter as long as its IP. Due to our unique approach, we have a clientless endpoint which extends ZTN with mTLS, E2EE and more to the users browser without the user (or admins) loading anything on their device.  \n\n\nZiti has been described by a large US defence contractor as \"the best adherence to NIST 800-207 across the widest variety of use cases\" and is being built into one of the 4 hyperscalers for them to build their own ZTN offering for replacing internal VPNs and selling to their customers.   \n\n\nWhat Ziti does not do is provide SWG/CASB, we focus on providing the worlds best ZTN.",

They rely on dynamic-tunneling over a single transport which IMHO in todays environment where the apps and data are everywhere makes less sense. Today's hub is everywhere but you'd be constraining your network topology to a single-DC 2010 architecture with some flexibility to support site-to-site traffic.\n* A bug or CVE in firewall forces you into upgrading and revalidating SD-WAN functions as expected and vice-versa. (fixing one feature might break another. Everything is a tradeoff. Unify functions / features into single platform sounds great but has drawbacks as well).\n\nCisco:\n\nGood:\n\n* Full mesh SD-WAN out of the box.\n* One of the strongest SD-WAN architectures / protocol driven fabric / central control plane that has extremely powerful policies / features that influence how you steer traffic.\n\nBad:\n\n* No L7 firewall, you'd have to rely on a third party product to break out traffic locally at your site, or subscribe to SSE and tunnel your traffic to a SASE vendor in the cloud (or build your own in the cloud).\n* Cost/Licensing complexity\n\nBoth vendors suffer from software quality issues so hard to compare this.",

The only way to determine the quality of the path is to measure it and you can't measure a tunnel that hasn't been built. The transport Fortinet chooses to build dynamic tunnels is based on metrics from spoke-to-hub. It assumes that the best transport from spoke-to-hub will also be the best transport for spoke-to-spoke. On the internet all bets are off. It might have been working for you, but brownout conditions, suboptimal routing and not having active/active load balancing between spokes is a drawback for me. You might end up sending traffic over a suboptimal path while waiting for a static SLA threshold to trigger a different path. We have 50 routers deployed in the cloud all of which have critical infrastructure and apps behind them. I want those locations to be treated like a hub-site for all my locations and not rely on a single or dual hub to signal when a temporary dynamic tunnel will be established. I looked at Fortinet and thought they had a compelling product. This was the only thing that held me back from taking it further. I hope they'll provide a full-mesh option in the future with the ability to apply policy directly on the route-reflectors to influence route tables, path prioritization and per-region SLA's.",

To prevent that hairpin but maintain a good security posture you'd need on-prem NGFW.\n\nThere are a number of apps (like O365) that recommend split-tunneling directly from VPN / Sites in order to improve performance and have traffic reach the MSFT backbone closest to the end user. They guarantee the security around Office 365. You might not have implemented this or not needed to, but many companies did. Having the ability to break out traffic locally would probably be more preferred for SIP traffic as well.\n\nThere is a place where SSE is a good fit and works great, but not every use case / business case deals well with it. SSE works pretty well securing site-&gt;internet but getting it to work reliably as a corporate backbone / transit comes with challenges and has many drawbacks. Ask any prisma access customers how they dealt made dynamic routing scale and implemented route filtering in that environment. AWS Cloud WAN has its own limitations as well (5000 routes?) limited filtering capability, anycast? etc.\n\nIf you are in retail or are a 100% saas shop with limited to no east-west traffic between your sites the SSE model is an easy button and arguably wouldn't even require SD-WAN.",

Fortinet kind of claims that zero-trust superseds VPN solutions, but I never get that. I mean if I have resources that I only can and need to access in my own network, how could I reach them safely only with a zero-trust-model? \n\nThe way to access them and to not give the whole world access to the data I have transfered is via an encrypted, secured connection - in other words a VPN. And zero-trust would say \"you can only access it if your Windows runs the current patchlevel\" and such stuff - but an attacker could have a fully patched Windows as well.\n\nSo I don't get it and it seems to me that it's more a marketing-term, but eventually you still need VPNs for the usecases mentioned above.\n\nPlease shed some light on it - thanks!",

You can have user based permissions to specific „apps“ via classic vpn too and you should do so… kinda irritates me when people say vpn is a onetime login to access everything… if you configure your vpn like that its true but thats not the vpns fault but the admins.\n\nOnly thing that i‘d say is pro ztna is the continuous host checks /conditional access that will kill any connection to your infrastructure if the client disables its local firewall or gets infected by some virus or something. But thats comes with the drawback of extra software to install on your client which will ultimately bring other risks (which fortinet for example has shown multiple times with several cve‘s)\n\nI‘d say go the typical vpn way if you want a the least overhead and a secure solution.",

FG themselves is scratching their head (as most forum related posts). All the long-established namespaces and folder referrals are defined as FQDN (per FG June 24 KB) - we are moving to next step which is properly flag all server configs as enabledFQDN just to see if that helps. \n\nOf course there will be other challenges: like AD password changes to sync on local workstation, possible other AD related issues (Trust). And gone would be the days of asking an end user to provide bare bone IPconfig info to eliminate some basic TS steps. \n\nI am not sold on easier management either, as everything needs to be defined, and that can be \\*fun\\* in environments that are not as well documented/controlled/structured as they should be (which seems more the rule than not in Small-Medium business). Stating it is a good time to implement those controls is great, but without complete buy-in from the top, it goes nowhere as there is always something 'more pressing'. It's like trying to re-organize a file server structure (something not technically difficult but too 'hard' for the end users). \n\nI actually find the tech pretty intriguing but far from sold from a practical standpoint based on what our customer base is like.

For example, a remote subject should not be required to use a link back to the enterprise network (i.e., virtual private network [VPN]) to access services utilized by the enterprise and hosted by a public cloud provider (e.g., email).\"\n- [NIST SP 800-207, page 22](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf)\n\nWhy is this? Because VPNs utilize the perimeter problem, assuming that \"if a user gets into the network they've passed all checks.\" And Zero Trust absolutely does not care if a user passed the check on session-start, it wants to check continuously throughout the session, for each action, in order to ensure the user isn't doing anything they shouldn't be doing. Or as NIST puts it:\n\n&gt; “It is no longer feasible to simply enforce access controls at the perimeter of the enterprise environment and assume that all subjects (e.g., end users, applications, and other non-human entities that request information from resources) within it can be trusted.”\n\n— Line 259, Page 1, [SP 1800-35b from the National Institute of Standards and Technology \\(NIST\\)](https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/sites/default/files/2022-12/zta-nist-sp-1800-35b-preliminary-draft-2.pdf).\n\nZero trust supersedes VPN solutions because VPNs and ZTNA solutions in general lack continuous verification and context-aware access (also called out in SP 800-207 as fundamental to ZT).",

            "body": "A perspective to consider as I think the entire market is confused about these terms and overgeneralizes them.\n\nVPN represents a secure way to establish a \"CONNECTION\" (a.k.a a Virtual Private Network). Access control is not really a part of its fundamental makeup. This may come as a shocker for some, but how do you even get to \"access control\" without first establishing a secure connection? Keeping it relative to what we're discussing, of course, which is \"network access\" (ZT \"Network Acceess\").\n\nIf you want to address secure connectivity with modern access controls then you get a solution that allows for secure connectivity (a.k.a a VPN connection) that allows you to address those access controls (e.g. a solution that allows you to adopt ZTNA).\n\nMost suppliers out there jamming ZTNA down our collective throats start as creating secure connectivity (or a Virtual Private Network overlay). Zscaler creates the secure overlay connection (VPN connection). Netskope does. Palo does. Cato Networks does. etc., etc., etc.\n\nIf you are a remote user (even when you're not sometimes) and you need secure access to private resources while employing ZTNA....guess what? You're still creating a secure overlay connection (a.k.a Virtual Private Nework)!!!!\n\nStop running away from VPN and over to ZTNA. One doesn't exist without the other and the only differences to debate in the end is the architecture of the supplier, what traffic they actually support and their application of Security inspection.\n\n\"Does your remote access solution allow me to adopt a ZTNA strategy, support all my relevant applications and allow me to inspect the traffic the way I need to?\" Who the F cares what acronyms we give the product/service in the end? To me, it's just secure remote access the way I need it.",

Why are so many security issues? Because its scanned and pen tested like the hell nowadays like never before... (all started with hearthbleed couple of years ago)... Wait when ipsec vpn is comming more to the attention. On the one hand it uses \"SSL\", cause its a good standard. You also do trust websites with HTTPS? right?! right? \\[insert anakin/padme meme here\\]\n\nNow to IPSEC. yeah working, but the traffic doesn't look like anymore like SSL, (event with TCP) which can lead to problems if some starbucks or hotel wifi doesn't allow ipsec (not just on the ports, just on the type of traffic/protocol). So with SSL mostly the traffic looks like you are accessing some secure webpage which works for almost any other starbucks/hotel internet.\n\nNow to ZTNA.. oh my god, i cannot hear that marketing bullshit anymore (throwing things together in some box and mix it together, every vendor in different ways, and then lets sell the cloud boys it with a big whoop). It works for simple stuff (http,https, and mostly known protocols). But if you need access to some specific protocol (like some SAP Connection stuff, cause the SAPGUI legacy is used, AND IT IS USED, or some \"you cannot think of time tracking protocol for devices\".. that will not work. So ZTNA is NOT a FULL replacement for a VPN. Hence its not a type of access, its a philosophy... (Btw, you can use ztna tags within a dialup connection (ssl/ipsec) if you have an ems). In the end ask yourself which protocol ZTNA itself uses ... \n\nAgain: Ipsec over TCP.. I'm not getting wet here, some extra ports? We're in 2024/2024.. thats like doing some extra protocol shit in 1998..\n\nSo imho, currently i would still stick to SSLVPN if you have the hardware (and for sure not use the latest major/minor release.. who uses 7.6.0 now ????.. wait at least till patchlevel 5 or 6 or higher xD )\n\nIf you have some smaller device where SSLVPN is going be deprecated you should focus on IPSEC VPN Dialup\n\nSadly It would be nice if they have wireguard support.. but well, than they cannot sell the ZTNA Bullshit as Access!\n\nWritten with many alcohol ;)",

Functionally it has been working great for us, and has been easy to deploy.\n\nCisco/viptela was a mess for us during the poc, and others in this threat have expressed similar feelings to what I came out of the poc with. Overly complex, ui sucks, templates are a pain in the ass.\n\nWe didn't look at juniper, but looked at silverpeak (this was just as the hpe buyout was announced) the pos was good, and we kind of liked it better than velo based on the poc. \n\nOur decision with velo cloud came down to our buisneess needs. We're are more like an msp, and we host a bunch of services for our clients in our data centers. We needed multi tenant support. Silver peak didn't have a solution for that relative to our size (it was targeted at much larger isp customers and out of budget). Cisco viptela was a mess for us from beginning to end in the Poc, and their pricing/hardware requiments for us to setup the datacenter side of things was very high and would have only covered capacity for about half of our final deployment goals.  Velo cloud had the features we needed, easy setup and deployment, and the costs for deployment into our Datacenters was much better.

        "selftext": "So, like many of you, I am now in getting quotes on a mid-lifecycle datacenter VMware support agreement and have heard horror stories about price hikes. I wanted to post my experience to address my understanding of the new pricing model.\n\nWe are running 12 CPU sockets in total that would need to be licensed under the old VMware model. Now, the model has moved to core licensing, which must be purchased at a minimum of 16 cores. We will now need to instead license for 192 cores under the new model.\n\nPrevious ballpark quotes for support renewal came in \\~$14,000 for all those sockets plus the VCSA licensing. Now, we are looking at \\~$35,000 for the same support renewal. That is a %300 increase for an annual renewal; hope you have room for that unbudgeted increase this year.\n\nNow as for the complete lifecycle cost, this is where I am unsure on the value proposition from the new VMware model. Previously, you would budget say $100,000 up front for VMware licensing for a datacenter of our size, then after the first 3 years you would pay \\~$14,000 until you upgrade the datacenter, typically after a total of 7 years, or an additional 4 years, so a total of $156,000 in licensing over the lifecycle.\n\nNow, for the new model, you do not have that upfront licensing cost as it is subscription based, so for our datacenter it is that 7 years at $35,000 a year, or $245,000. That is a %63 increase using these primarily speculatory and informed guesses of numbers above. That said, it is more palatable than %300, but certainly greatly disappointing.\n\nNow for a gripe and a question:\n\nGripe - Why dose Broadcom does not have a program in place for mid-life datacenters like us, and like I am sure a huge number of clients, to soften that OpEx spend of a subscription when a thing like a datacenter has a near decade long budget. I know the answer is because \"Fuck you, pay us\", but this seems like a simple thing they could do to soften the blow and earn some good will from their newly acquired userbase.\n\nQuestion: How do my numbers line up with what any of you have experience with your renewals so far? If you just signed new agreements with VMware coming from something else, or spinning up a new Hypervisor, were there any upfront licensing cost, or is really just that subscription price of $189/Core of VMware Foundation?",

I've found that Proxmox is a solid choice, particularly given the growing shift away from VMware. Additionally, for those who are used to VMware vSAN and might be looking for a similar solution, Starwinds VSAN is now compatible with Proxmox: [https://www.starwindsoftware.com/resource-library/starwind-virtual-san-vsan-configuration-guide-for-proxmox-vsan-deployed-as-a-controller-virtual-machine-cvm/](https://www.starwindsoftware.com/resource-library/starwind-virtual-san-vsan-configuration-guide-for-proxmox-vsan-deployed-as-a-controller-virtual-machine-cvm/)\n\n&gt;it looks like veeam now supports proxmox\n\nIt's still not VBR, but it's definitely a step in the right direction.",

Just overall bad leaders trying to manage high tech, and failing miserably.\n\nIf you follow the money, it was Dell and VMware together.  \nTerrible, fucken terrible management - so many things were broken and already failing. For those that had Microsoft environment and could make the transition to Hyper-V or partial VMware solutions, it worked in the favor of open architecture.\n\nThose with exclusive or proprietary architecture, Broadcom has those orgs strapped with invisible handcuffs, and the only way out is to break your fingers if the budget is tight.\n\nBroadcom comes in and takes VMware. $69B acquisition. Don't be surprised if they start micro-charging with the subscription and new license models.\n\nPay up, or start planning for offboarding from VMware.\n\nOne of our clients was too lazy to implement vSphere integration because they didn't want to pay the hiked fees. Client wastes ton of money anyway, so I didn't care - (ie- millions of dollars of failing CapEx projects that will eventually cost many more millions to fix in the years to come, they're too lazy to audit the projects and just approve almost everything... \"morons\").\n\nBegin operation workflow audits so that it's done early for itemizing a timed migration workflow.  \nEventually, sooner or later, you're going to be glad that the infrastructure had it in the works - because no one wants a sloppy turnover that is more time restricted than most can ask for.  \nSlow and steady is cooking speed done right.",

When you are managing multiple devices at once, Barracuda's control center makes it absolutely trivial. The only one that comes close in terms of multitenancy is Fortinet, but I absolutely love the ability of the barracuda to migrate an IP/network configuration to a different physical or logical interface without removing references and things like that. You can set up a new LACP LAG and just select it as an interface for an existing IP configuration. It's insanely easy. Everything is intuitively segregated out into distinct modules, and they use a proprietary IPSec extension called TINA to use multi-WAN site-to-site tunnels that is also really good.\n\nI'm an engineer though, things like price don't matter to me at all, but they do to the customer.",

But if you work alot with whitelisting, you might need to send custom applications to a 'bought'  static IP. Which preferably you buy 2 in different regions so you have a fallback in case one of the PoP's goes down. \n\n  \nBut yeah overall very positive on CATO!\n\n(But fair to say i don't know any of the others, from Dutchy perspective they are not well known, at least to me.)",

            "body": "\\+1 for Cato. Lots of customers on it. Enterprise rich platform but priced for all business sizes. Believe their minimum user licensing requirement meets your profile of customer (10+ users).\n\nIt does sound like, based on the other suppliers you're considering, that you're really looking for an SSE solution. I didn't gather that you're in the market for a \"networking\" (SD-WAN) solution as well.\n\nP81 isn't bad, but not nearly as feature rich as Cato. Pricing is pretty similar, I believe. The thing with Cato that could impact pricing a bit is whether or not you need to also support users accessing private resources in a physical or virtual/cloud datacenter. They do charge a \"site\" license to onramp those sites/resources, whereas others don't necessarily charge for that leg. Unsure about P81, but Netskope and Zscaler don't charge for their \"app connector\" (which is the part of the solution that onramps a datacenter / app resource).\n\nIf you to onramp private resources, most other solutions don't have good (or any) inline traffic inspection to private resources. An example...user somehow gets ransomware on their endpoint and they are permitted to access a fileshare in a Datacenter. Most other solutions won't identify and block that malicious traffic, but Cato would. You could argue that's worth the premium associated with paying to onramp a private resource through Cato.\n\nIf your needs are 100% SaaS based, Cato prices very competitively to the rest of the market.  \nIf your needs extend into networking as well (including things like SD-WAN), then Cato is by far the best comprehensive SASE solution in my opinion and has a really strong value for MSPs with it's multi-tenanted cloud management application.",

I just got done doing my part to configure our company's new  datacenter infrastructure and insisted on using Management interfaces where as the old datacenter didn't utilize these.  The reason being that the out of band management switches that the management interfaces connect to will downlink to distribution switches that our PC LAN is connected to, so if there is a production interface config change that goes bad, we won't get kicked out of the device we were configuring and will still have access to it.  It's some extra work to set up but I highly advocate using management interfaces for production networks in this manner.",

However there is a few reasons I would start using the dedicated ports. \n- the devices are located north of your main perimeter firewalls. This helps to keep the devices a bit more secured. Plus it is harder (not impossiable) to make a config mistake that exposes the device.\n- the devices are part of a aoftware defined fabric / highly automated. Automation is great but does also allow you to kill your network really quickly. Having an out of band network to get backing without having to walk around a load of switches and console in my be quicker. It might also help automate the rollback. Golden rule is automate through the out of band port, but never modify the out of band port using automation .\n- mission critical / high security enviroments, management traffic being in band. On a vlan means all management traffic is on the main network. This makes is easier for an attacker to intercept. In some of the more secure environments I work in we have all management ( ssh, syslog, snmp etc) done out of band with this network then only being connected to a hardened jukebox and firewall. ( similar to devices north of the firewall ). \n- the site is remote with no local IT and by the time you have got there the business would have lost a of of money. Having a dedicated out of band network at this point my also be advantageous going into a little firewall on its own adsl/4g run running remote access VPN. \n\nWritten on a phone before my morning coffee; have mercy",

These are good to have, and good to segregate from client-facing/client-bearing interfaces at L2/L3.\n  \nYour device-dedicated-interfaces and lights-out interfaces on the other hand need to be reachable via secondary methods - these are the out-of-band connections that will enable you to bring back up your network in the event of a 'common network' failure.  They can be reachable from your 'common network' via intermediary devices like jump-servers or firewalls, but they should not *depend* on your 'common network' to be reachable or accessible.  To me, it is important for these to be L1 segregated (distinct physical) so that physical/logical disruptions of your 'common network' cannot become disruptions to your OOB network.  \n  \nI realize this may not be everyone's take on the subject, so please take this with a grain of salt and weigh your own access-needs accordingly.",

(and this is not a sarcastic question, but rather a serious one). Nowadays you normally have a whole bunch of IoT and network devices in your home LAN that I would advise you to limit access as much as you can like cameras, NAS, Smart TVs and Appliances, etc. etc. VLAN segregation is part of a layered approach to that kind of security level if you cannot afford a firewall. The application of ACLs, NBAR and stuff like that, is easier and less impactful (for the rest of the network) the more segmented the network is as long as you know what you are doing. Suspicious ports and protocols are easier to spot when the network is properly segmented than if everything is the same vlan. For instance, why would you see traffic on port UDP 5246/5247 and UDP 16666/16667 (ports used by APs and WLCs for CAPWAP and EoIP) in the vlan for your smart TVs or your Smart Refrigerator? Why would your camera have an SSH session with a device in the internet if that port is not specified in the manufacturer's manual as an indispensable port? The MGMT interface is very important from the security standpoint since in the vast majority of switches from Cisco, for instance, that interface is actually placed by default in a VRF thus segregating it from the rest of the switch completely, although the real value of the MGMT interface is more visible in devices residing in the DMZ, though. If the switch is properly configured you can force access to that switch via MGMT interface and thus creating a single point of access to that switch. The main reason why I see people not configuring it, like you correctly point out, is out of sheer laziness (not having to configure a mgmt vlan and interface), nothing else nothing more.  \nb) Is this a lab you use as study tool?  \nIf this is a lab environment then all this work is not necessary, at least for me, because the labs I've used in the past I do for a very specific task or config. After I test everything is stable and working I reset all equipment so whatever extra effort I employ goes down the proverbial \"drain\" along with the old config.",

My goal is to treat it as one would treat a high availability, production network in an enterprise environment.\n\nDon't get me wrong, however.  That's my aspiration, but I fail at it quite a bit too, mostly out of shear laziness.\n\nThe lab is used as a study tool, for poking around, kicking the tires and for doing things that would be a resume generation event at work.  That said, I would like to eventually take some of the lab gear (several L3 switches of which a couple are 3850's) and use it at home for *live* network use.\n\nI am really interested in network automation but less so from the perspective of rapid deployment, network analysis, etc. and more so of what could I do for the person that is having to frequently console in to various switches and routers.  For example, in my current role, we had to deploy several hundred Extreme Networks 4950 switches.  Each and every one of them had to be powered up, connected to via console and verified that each had a certain software version or better, and a specific PoE firmware version or higher and then a few basic configuration parameters before they received their *pre-deployment* configuration.   Later, once they had been racked and put into a stack configuration, we'd console back in and give them their pre-deployment configuration which made them remotely available.  When the final configuration had been approved it would then be pushed out to the stack remotely.\n\nSo my network automation perspective is from the person having to do work like that (not exclusively, but as an example) which seems to be lost and forgotten.  At least from what I have seen.  Therefore a lot of my lab play time is geared in that direction.",

If you use Python which is kind of like a \"poor guy's solution\" (do not underestimate Python, though) you just need a library like Netmiko or Paramiko that is going to allow you to SSH into the devices to gather the info needed, or issue commands in the CLI there, and then you can compile the info as you see fit.***   \n \"Later, once they had been racked and put into a stack configuration, we'd console back in and give them their pre-deployment configuration which made them remotely available\"  \n***Well, in this case idk what your workplace monetary situation is but if you have a console switch like an OpenGear Console switch (https://opengear.com/product-selector/) you could rack them right away, run the necessary commands with the Python script to know if they are in the version you want them to be and then deploy the pre and post deployment configs.***   \n***Like I said above, do not underestimate Python for your automating needs. I use it quite often and it is a skill that is always good to have. Matter of fact, I can bet a bottom dollar in time that if you do not know how to code, especially in Python, you are not going to be able to get any Cisco Certification in about 10 years time. There's a couple of courses for Python for Networking in Udemy that you can literally get for 11 dollars on a holiday. I took a purely Python course  that was a \"from beginner to advanced user\" first (https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/) which was purely Python and I learned a good deal of great coding skills. Then got the Python for Network Engineers one (https://www.udemy.com/course/python-programming-for-cisco-network-engineers/) to know the networking libraries available and how to use them (like Netmiko) which obviously was a more network-oriented one. Both of them were superb and I have benefitted quite a lot from the knowledge acquired there.***",

            "body": "I actually took a course on Python from Georgia Tech through [eDx](https://www.edx.org) that was extremely good and got me started.  Then discovered there were worlds of things that could be solved with Python in networking.  As I looked into it more and more while at my last job I was kind of dismayed at all the focus (and I'm not sure I am articulating this well) on the use of Python for network analytics, of course the configuration aspect and so on, but so little on it from the perspective of the person out in the field that is having to console in to do various, often repetitive, tasks.   So that's where I kind of zeroed in.  What can I do in this space with Python.\n\nI have written a few scripts here and there.  At my last job, (an oil company) they had literally hundreds and hundreds of field wireless radios.  When they did wide scale upgrades, they could only do spot checks for anything that may have gone wrong and a friend I knew in that group approached me to see if I could come up with something that would allow them to do a wider scale validation that there were no serious issues from any upgrades, changes, etc.\n\nSo I wrote up a program that, simply, pinged each device (they would give me a spreadsheet with all the subnets that needed to be checked) to make sure it was available, then it would log into the device and make sure the web interface was available and then generate a log output of what devices validated and which did not.\n\nIt was rather simple in the grand scheme of things and I went on to work on a couple other things for that group like that.  It validated to me the need, but also showed me that there is more to network automation than just the analytics and configuration aspects.\n\nWhen I started the current role I am in it further demonstrated that there is a great deal of opportunity to use Python for more *boots on the ground* type things as I mentioned earlier.\n\nWith respect to my current role, it is in a hospital and they have no where near the structure the oil company did.  As far as I know, they only use Solar Winds for network monitoring and that only to the extent that emails are sent out to alert for *larger* issues.  There is no dedicated NOC as with the oil company.  As such, I get the impression, based on conversations and suggestions, they would be completely open to a *poor mans* solution to things.\n\nI know, long winded, and I'm sorry, but that's the realm I am kind of moving in and where I spend a good chunk of time with on my personal lab setup.",

Most of our switches use the interface vs an SVI.\n\n&gt; is it better or best practice to use a Mgmt VLAN over a Mgmt Interface?\n\nIt's not really a best-practice issue, it's a purpose issue. If your switch is carrying the management VLAN, then it's likely a management switch and already isolated from the core network. You might use the interface in this case to change the switching path to that device, but in most cases like this, you will be using an SVI.\n\nIf your switch *does not* carry the management VLAN, then an SVI can't help you. In this case the only option is the management interface.\n\nThe management interface also usually comes with a default config that's more secure then a generic SVI. With an SVI on an L3 switch, that switch will happily route any packets it sees on any networks it's connected to straight to your control and management planes. With the interface, it's usually at least in it's own VRF, and probably has some default COPP rules in place.",

Is it actually shit, maybe? That kind of stuff. It would be so valuable to be able to quote users.  \n\nSorry if I am being a dick, I just really want this job :)",

I very very rarely run into any bugs.\n\nThird is the hardware/software performance.  With Checkpoint, you have to double the specs of the hardware to be able to turn all the blades on.  The FAT client sucks.\n\nFourth, upgrades.  The upgrade process is so smooth. I've upgraded the OS at least 6 times now and not one single issue ever.\n\nFifth, letting me POC unit without questions.  You want to try a 5220?  Here you go, overnight'ed a HA pair.\n\nSixth, the support is really good and is mostly in the US.\n\nSeventh, AppID.  AppID is so useful in creating rule sets based upon the application and not guessing on what ports products use and will also give you a list of other ports/appid that are dependent on it.\n\nI could probably keep going.  Their product is just so stable, user interface is nice, everything makes sense and is stable\n\nI've used Checkpoint and Firepower and I will never, ever use them again.",

            "body": "I manage a bunch of PA and some Firepowers aaS and as someone how worked only with Cisco before, I feel you. By a large margin, PA is better in almost every single aspect. The interface is wonderful, intuitive and is almost the same in Panorama and the firewalls (even traps is similar).\n\nI already worked from PA-200 to PA-7050, hit almost no bugs. Every platform is stable (The only exception will be the old PA-2050, which was a pain in the ass) and even though the 200 and 500 GUI are a bit slow, 3020 and above have fast commit time and the interface loads quickly.\n\nThe upgrade procedure is really great. One situation that comes up to my mind is that weeks ago I updated two HA pairs (different models) from 5.0 to 8.1 and not a single issue with the configuration or the upgrade process. Both pairs were in production, no downtime.\n\nSupport was good most of the time, I got the dev team once on a painful migration of a Panorama to Panorama mode and they were really knowledgeable. Once it took more than one hour and a half to get someone in the line for a sev1 tough, this evolved upper level management and it never happened again.\n\nRule creation and security profiles are really well designed and works wonderfully. Its pretty different compared to cisco, but you'll get used to it.\n\nAlso, seems to me that people dont care but the CLI is really good! You have a lot of testing commands,  different log files for each thing/process (one for user-id, one for vpn, etc) and dataplane/management plane logs are kept separate so debugging is really easy. Also the configuration is in XML format, so with the API you get a ton of automation and cool scripts.\n\nNow, about managing PAs, one thing that I really like are the reports, really customizable and useful. Mix that with the cool ACC panel and Threat, network and App monitor you have cool stuff to show the customer, show your manager, create reports and keep yourself update about what is happening. Its just really easy to work with.\n\nTL;DR: Working with PA I notice how good is an equipment with only one unified firmware and responsive and logic UI and well thought CLI format.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.s.: English is not my native lang, sorry for any mistake.",

This just could be a R77.30 issue I had or maybe I was just pushing the Checkpoints harder but for me I have never had a single core performance issue on a PA like I have had on Checkpoints.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Winner: PA**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Palo Alto support has been exceptional over the years, Checkpoint have also been very good. I don't think I could pick a winner here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Draw!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Global Protect is probably one of the best VPN technologies I have used, Checkpoint just don't have anything to compete in this area.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Winner : PA**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Checkpoint have a The Threat Cloud just like PA have Wildfire but I like how you can hold back a file until the Checkpoint Threat Cloud has made a decision. Wildfire does not have this option.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Winner : Checkpoint**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The interface on the PA is just a much nicer experience, the fact that Checkpoint needs a separate bit of software installed on your endpoint for Firewall rule management and also a separate web GUI for the GAIA portal means that you need to use 2 different location to setup different settings. PA does this from a single location so none of this \"Is is in management is it in GAIA?\" situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Winner : PA**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Please keep in mind this is my experience only and I expect there are just as many people who would say the complete opposite to me as would agree with me!  If you use Checkpoint or PA you are in very good hands, both are exceptional bits of kit with good support and I trust both not only to do a good job now, but to carry on pushing the boundaries of how firewalls can protect a business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope this is of some help and good luck!",

I've been extremely impressed with XCP-NG + Xen Orchestra, I hadn't look at them since before XCP-NG forked from Citrix's XenServer. It'd probably be my go to for an SMB.\n\nTrueNAS doesn't do HCI with failover (yet?) and TrueNAS SCALE is still beta, so that's probably not something worth looking at. That said, TrueNAS Core (FreeBSD based one) is rock solid and was the storage backbone for my homelab for a long time. Just moved over to SCALE to test some stuff out and that has been solid (though I wouldn't deploy to an enterprise). \n\nIf you go the TrueNAS route, get a system from IXsystems that's first party with warranty, support, and configuration. They're great to work with and can make sure that the system is configured correctly. There's thousands of little tweaks you can do to tune performance for various workloads with ZFS.",

            "body": "I always find this argument (the general cloud Vs on prem costs I mean, not your points specifically) frustrating.\n\nCloud VM prices are higher, but to me that's not the point of cloud. Lifting and shifting VM workloads to cloud is nearly always not the most cost effective way to utilise cloud. Transforming your application to work in a more cloud \"native\" (god I really hate that term) way as part of your migration will lower your cloud costs significantly and likely improve resilience. That said I accept that rarely happens.\n\nThe staff and maintenance costs of on prem, over and above the hardware and energy costs others have already mentioned, are not insubstantial either.\n\nOn a slightly different tack another thing I never hear people talking about when comparing these costs is the feature parity between cloud and on prem, cloud is expensive sure but the majority of providers all come with automation and APIs for all your major building blocks (compute, storage, networking etc.) and far more, available for app teams to use to deploy workloads.\n\nIn my experience on prem environments are much more closed off in terms of who can access your VMware clusters to deploy VMs for example, same for storage or network provisioning.\n\nEven assuming your company is a bit more open than most I've worked at in terms of allowing app teams to deploy things themselves without going through a central infrastructure team (aka bottleneck) then to get feature parity you still need heavy investment of time and money to get the automation in place to be able to work in the same modern way on prem as you get baked into the price in the cloud. And frankly even then your solution will likely be a bit janky and held together with glue, or some overly expensive solution that ties you into specific hardware/software combinations.\n\nDon't get me wrong, VMware can be great and has its use cases, but direct compute comparisons with cloud don't tell nearly the whole story.",

            "body": "I respect your argument. What I will say, and I respect that you’ve touched on it here, is one of the MOST important points as to why the cloud vs on prem argument in the majority of cases falls apart (80-90%) is the following. Cloud is more cost effective if you transform your application to a non-monolithic architecture (in fact sometimes it’s really not but we’ll leave that out of this equation) and how many companies migrate with a lift and shift to cloud under the premise that once migrated they’ll begin a per app transformation? Almost all of them. How many achieve it? Almost zero. \n\nThe reason is usually down to poor management, marketing tactics and economics. Poor management is where enterprise leaders think they’ll have transformed everything by the time the three years of stepped public cloud discounts vanish, in reality many technical teams haven’t finished their lift and shift within the first 12-24 months. Marketing from CSPs indicate theres less technical engineering team members required to operate your public cloud platform. That’s categorically false, it’s usually the same number and at a significantly higher cost per engineer. Lastly the economics of CSPs don’t allow everyone to take advantage of for example a serverless architecture.. imagine you were a $2.2 trillion dollar cloud business who’s continued highly profitable and high top line revenue is predicated on customers continuing to leverage an incredibly expensive monolithic VM based architecture that adopts a simple, single PaaS service that make it sticky/challenging for them to leave (usually the database service) - overnight every customer migrated to some type of transactional microservices/serverless architecture where the cost is 10% of the old architecture. What happens to the top line revenue of that business? A catastrophic share price crash happens. In fact the only way that no-win-scenario is resolved is that cloud native/architectures will have to slowley increase in cost as more customers transform to those architectures to the point where it’s in parity of more expensive than Virtual Machines. Public cloud is incredibly cheap for Non-VM based workloads, because that’s the target, once you’re locked in, the economics will shift. This is not a ‘ah but’ or an ‘if that happens’ this is just business and economics of cloud dictate that unless something new comes along, this will happen.\n\n\nAlso a VCF and VMware Cloud Director platform provides all of the features and capabilities you mentioned, fully API driven just like AWS or Azure but I do agree the licensing jumps to about $20 per core per VM per month. \n\nI really enjoyed your arguments, power is certainly an interesting one. One concern for competition is Datacentre providers being denied access to the national grid, I see Microsoft is looking at micro nuclear reactors for Datacentre and if AWS and google do the same that would constrain competition even further allowing them to retain their price control. A bit theoretical and 10-15 years away but it’s something we’ll be talking about in a few years.",

        "selftext": "Hi, we're implementing SSL Inbound Inspection, but it seems to have a huge impact on the throughput. However, the dataplane CPU never gets above 6%, Management CPU 11%. Using PA-220 9.0.4. I know SSL Forward Proxy has an impact on the dataplane CPU, but we're not using that at the moment.\n\nCurrently, we're testing 1 webserver with SSL Inboud Inspection. We have an 80/80 Mbit fiber connection. Only service-https is allowed and ssl/web-browsing apps. Log only at session End. User-ID is enabled.If we download files from the webserver from an external location with SSL inbound **disabled**, we're hitting 80 Mbit upload. If we **enable** SSL inbound inspection, the maximum upload is about about 25 Mbit, and transfers pause for a couple of seconds, every 30 seconds or so. (the D/U meter displays small mountains /----\\\\\\_/------\\\\\\_/--------\\\\).\n\nWhile the dataplane CPU and Management CPU are practically doing nothing, how can we explain this throughput impact? We're losing 60% of the throughput.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[80\\/80 mbps connection](https://preview.redd.it/uv3teaqeguw31.png?width=527&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=781c646fa0efab54f00e3cbfa1d73bf73b9755dd)\n\nEDIT: thanks for all the info guys. I did some more research and testing, and the impact is **relative** to the maximum bandwidth. I've put the PA-220 on a 500/500 mbps connection, and with SSL inbound disabled I'm also able to utilize the maximum upload (around **57 MB/sec**). However, with SSL inbound enabled, is drops to a maximum upload of **8 MB/sec**:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[500\\/500 mbps connection](https://preview.redd.it/agkabygaj4y31.png?width=400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed911d14d5736ed0ccd9e7f8e1c84834a4747c46)\n\nSo yes, the impact is heavy, but relative to the available bandwidth. With an 80/80 mbps line, the SSL inbound decryption upload was around 25 mbps. With an 500/500 mbps line, the SSL inbound decryption upload was around 80 mbps.  \nI will test the PA-220 on a 1 gbps line later this month.",

        "selftext": "We are in the process of onboarding a new customer that has some FortiGate firewalls and FortiAPs.  Nothing has a license.  Fortinet isn't in our stack, but there are reasons why the customer wants to keep some or all of the equipment if possible.\n\nAt the urging of the team at TDSynnex, I filled out a partner application form on the Fortinet web site.  A month went by and absolutely no response.\n\nI followed up with an email and a reply from someone on the Fortinet partner team said I should be hearing from someone that day.  Nope.  Not a word.\n\nSince then I've emailed and left a VM for the  partner rep.  No response.\n\nAt this point should I just tell the customer that Fortinet is a nightmare and we have to pull all of the hardware?",

You may be digging on this for a while.  Keep the old gear for reference in a lab or something.  Fortinet renewals aren't cheap, so unless there's a burning reason to keep it, it doesn't make much sense.  Don't get me wrong though, Fortinet firewalls are really good, but you're almost better off factory resetting them and starting over anyway since you may not know every single possible setting that may have been fked with by the other MSP.",

They were the most MSP friendly. They had a multitenant interface and it's really easy to add/remove licenses. But there are some downsides like you can't export your data to an external SIEM/SOC. It's per device, not per user, and A static ip is $2500 a month...  \n  \nP81 doesn't have those issues but it is a less mature offering, costs more per user, you're forced to use a single gateway when Todyl will let you roam between all of their gateways.  \n  \nA major competitor I forgot to mention is Zscaler, about the same price per endpoint as Todyl. The most mature of all the solutions. You can buy it through Avast or Barracuda at our market. It blows all the other ones out of the water except... It doesn't include the VPN component, and that doubles the cost. And it doesn't have any kind of central management.",

The reason the first part matters is that some vendors do not disclose internally discovered vulnerabilities and silently patch them. This means customers could be running unpatched firmware without realising they are vulnerable. Certain vendors are worse than others for that. Fortinet has a transparent disclosure policy and an aggressive PSIRT team, which leads them to discovering most of their own vulnerabilities (up to 85% is claimed). The second matters… well because of debacles like the recent PANW vulnerability.\n\nEnd of the day, make your own decision.

Hiding things definitely doesn't lead to better outcomes.\n\nThe more aggressive a vendor is in reviewing their own code for vulnerabilities, the more they will find. If they are finding the vulnerabilities, then fixing them and disclosing them, why is that bad?! I **want** all the vendors to be transparent. If vendors aren't looking at their code, they aren't finding their vulnerabilities, which means bad actors might. If they aren't disclosing the ones they do find, then it leaves their customers vulnerable because they have no idea that they need to patch it.\n\nThe real problem isn't disclosing vulnerabilities, as long as there's a patch or workaround (that works) available, It's the people who either don't patch or apply the workarounds because they're not keeping up with their cyber security, or are unable to. Getting people to patch their stuff is probably one of the biggest challenges in cyber security aside from asset management.",

We will probably peel off pieces (internet filtering) but I don't want to even think about what happens if we went a different directions.  I almost have our guys mostly functional on Palo after 2 years and I shudder to think if I threw a new FW at them.  We will probably bring in CheckPoint and Forti to pitch but I don't know if the jump would just make thigns worse.  The devil you know vs The sunk cost fallacy.",
