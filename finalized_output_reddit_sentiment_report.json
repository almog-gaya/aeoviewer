            "body": "It‚Äôs legitimate, but I‚Äôd recommend applying for scholarships that are more specialized and have less people applying for them to maximize your chances. I must have applied for at least 50 scholarships through a scholarship program and not gotten one. \n\nBut as for what I‚Äôd recommend applying for... find things that set you apart from a large number of people and use them. They don‚Äôt have to be individual characteristics. \n\nFor example, a lot of companies offer scholarships to their clients or their clients‚Äô kids. That includes banks, phone companies, power companies, etc. The pool will be smaller and more specialized, so you‚Äôll have a better shot at it. If you‚Äôre in high school, see if your county offers scholarships for juniors/ seniors (I got one through my school‚Äôs PTSA). \n\nAlso look for societies that support your major, as they might offer scholarships. For example, I‚Äôm in aerospace engineering, so I go after scholarships from the National Business Aviation Association, Vertical Flight Society, Society of Women Engineers, etc. Look for them on a state and national level. An incredible bonus of these is that they are so, so good for networking, and in my experience they try to look after their scholarship recipients (set you up with company higher-ups, invite you to conferences, etc.). They don‚Äôt just throw money at you and leave you in the dust. If you‚Äôre looking for an internship or a recommendation from someone in the industry, those connections can be incredible. \n\nIf you‚Äôre a dependent of a veteran or someone on active duty, I believe that there are a bunch of scholarships that you would qualify for (I haven‚Äôt looked into that so much because I‚Äôm not). Additionally, if you‚Äôre any kind of minority in your field, such as a Hispanic planning to major in STEM, there is a good chance that there are scholarships for you. Same with first generation students. \n\nIf you are an American citizen, depending on your major, you could also check out the DoD‚Äôs scholarships.\n\nAnything that you can think of that applies to you, but doesn‚Äôt apply to everyone, is a good bet. \n\nI‚Äôm really sorry for the wall of text. Overall, while free scholarship search engines are legitimate, there are so many people on them that you‚Äôre unlikely to receive anything. So, those are some alternatives. They payed off for me so much more than the multiple scholarship search engines I used, so I thought that I‚Äôd share them. Good luck!\n\nOut of curiosity, what‚Äôs your major?\n\n",

Each one has scholarships that are only found on their site, and some are definitely better than others. \n\nDON'T ignore local scholarships for national ones.

You should work on building things in all, but my opinion is to focus on volunteering. That is most students' weakest area. Make it quality, and try to do stuff that line up with your goals. The goal is to make all the individual areas into a cohesive story.\n\nWhen it comes to actually applying to scholarships, essays are going to be key. Having good test scores, high GPA, and class ranking will help, but a lot of students have that. Your essay is how you will stand out. Write what I call the 'Why Education' essay. What you want to major in, what led you to that, what you did in life (in school and outside of school) to move that direction, what your plans are for college, what your plans are for after college and how you will help the community or world with your degree. Make it passionate and personal, and if you have to overcome anything, include that. Make your essay a story others want to read. You can use versions of this essay for 90% of the scholarships you will apply to.\n\nTwo paid for recommendations that aren't a lot of $ but will help you, are Dave with Scholarship GPS-he has a video course, and Monica Matthews-she has an ebook. I highly recommend both.",

Coca-Cola. Look in your school website and see if they have some foundations listed.\n\nThis is important if you for sure know where you are going to college dive into their website. Start looking for deadlines for the Merit and base need those dates are early and most of the time you have to apply to those now in sept to dec. If you do not see the college scholarships site, call financial aid office.\n\nLook for volleyball scholarships. Look for general major (any major eligible) scholarships and search by your major too. Talk to your school counselor about your plan sometimes they have scholarships only for students attending that school only. Look into your state Department of Higer Education they have resources there too. Complete your FAFSA by November some scholarships ask for those details. Prepare a resume and start writing essays later you can revise again. Finaly, on Google type your town and scholarship foundation, your state and scholarship foundation. Ask if your parent employer offer scholarships for the employees' children.\n\nMake the list!",

It‚Äôs a centralized platform that streamlines applications and helps you apply to multiple scholarships from one dashboard.\n\n**üí° How it works:**\n\n* You fill out a profile with personal and academic details.\n* Based on that profile, it matches you to a pool of eligible scholarships.\n* You can use the system to autofill applications, track deadlines, and apply to multiple awards more efficiently.\n\n**üí∏ Cost:**\n\n* The platform is *not free* ‚Äî it operates on a monthly subscription model.\n* Pricing varies depending on the plan (standard or premium tiers).\n\n**üìù My Take:**  \nAs a current user, I‚Äôve found it useful for casting a wide net. I was recently awarded a **$1,000 scholarship** for graduate students after applying through the platform ‚Äî so it can absolutely work. That said, this resource might not be for everyone. If you‚Äôre highly self-organized and already know where to look, the value may be less significant.\n\nAlways weigh the cost vs. benefit based on your scholarship goals and bandwidth.",

But no use. \nI had a very old college professor who died recently I asked him for help \nHe made me a list of few books and also provided some second hand books. \nI stared reading it specially in night as I m a night owl and it helps me think. \nFirst reading was only to understand what the hell is this all about. From second I started minimising the data but never burdened my brain that I have to learn it all. Soon I was able to recall and understand. Then once the notes were made made a time table to JUST CASUALLY read it every Third day. \nBrain feels scared and burdened until it‚Äôs unfamiliar with the data. Once you started giving it the data every few days it becomes habitual. \nThen I solved the PYQS again and this time brain just knew how to eliminate the wrong. \nAnd that led to correct answer. \nPlus I started to understand from where the questions are coming from. \nThe I started my serious revision thinking let‚Äôs polish the knowledge and started learning in 1 hr cycle and 10 mints break in which I used CHATGPT to make MCQS for me In 4 stages -easy- moderate- difficult- ultra difficult \n\nI trained my brain for 7-8 months and appeared for first NET and qualified for PHD only as some marks were less in scoring NET \nAt that time I also knew what I m lacking and stared studying theory and criticism. Then I was more confident. This time the paper was too difficult but the previous study and the theory criticism helped me a lot. \nNow I have to focus on linguistic üòÖ \nI want to do PhD and I need scholarship for that.

        "selftext": "Hi guys, I just wanted to be beacon of hope especially for those who apply on bold.org. For background I'm a rising senior (in college not HS!) And due to some family financial issues, I needed 15k minimum in scholarships for my final year of college or drop out. I applied to over 100 scholarships (25+ of them being bold) and after 3 months and loads of rejections I started to feel hopeless. Bold.org seems really hard to win on as other reddit posts suggests so while at first I simply gave myself a good profile, collected a decent amount of points, I only put minimal effort into the essays. I only applied to bold essays that were matched/very niche for me. So low income, black, female, stem/my major scholarships only. After getting loads of bold rejections I gave up on bold. I actually started ignoring their emails because everytime it would just be a rejection. Until 2 days ago I got an email saying I won a 10k scholarships for low income, 1st gen, BIPOC STEM students in the PNW area (see how niche that is? That leaves me very little competition!). Because I have the bold account/bank card I received the money in that account the next day. It's insane! I started crying because between this and the handful of smaller scholarships I won last week, I don't have to worry about completing my degree anymore. I actually had an outstanding balance on my school account that has been preventing me for registering for Fall classes and I just paid it off! I just want everyone to keep applying....whether it's on bold or elsewhere. So far, I've received 20k in scholarships: 10k from bold.org, 4k from my university's environmental studies department (my major), an undisclosed TBD amount for honors on my campus, $1500 from point foundation, $1500 from my McNair TRIO program on campus, $500 (another TRIO scholarship), $3k Gilman (for my study abroad term). This totals to $20,500! Keep in mind there are dozens and dozens that I still have to hear back from! Let me know if yall need any advice.\n\nedit: won another 1k from my university. officially at $22k winnings. ",

Taught myself Japanese in high school then picked up a scholarship to do a year's exchange there (came back fluent), my high school had been teaching Chinese so then I focused on that and got a scholarship a few years later to study in Taiwan (am now fluent).  Learnt a bit of Greek when I was living in Cyprus and picked it up really quickly (alas, I've forgotten it all now as this all happened over about a year only) and now I'm in London so working on my French with DuoLingo and finding it pretty helpful (but what the FUCK is French?  People always come at me when I say Japanese is easy but look, once you get over the squiggles it's fine. It makes sense. It's repetetive, there are rules, there are no real exemptions.  What the *fuck* is French???)\n\nI would say that Japanese grammar is rather mathematical to me (I was learning HTML at the time and thought it was quite similar).  I find maths easier when I think of it as a language rather than...idk. Maths?\n\n\nAnyway, as a trade off, I'm absolutely shit at anything to do with my hands.  My handwriting is atrocious. I cannot learn a craft to save my life. I love to cook, but I get really good at cooking dishes, then don't cook it for a while and completely forget everything about the process. \n\n\nBut then -- I don't make crafty things a habit.  When I'm learning a language properly, I'll listen to the music, pick up some workbooks for basic grammar and stuff but focus on having a tutor and finding media in that language.  Some people are great at learning with flashcards but that just makes it too much like hard work to me -- I need to find stuff I like and engage with it on the daily (my french has fallen off a cliff since I stopped watching ladybug, even though I still do my duo to keep the murder owl happy). My thinking has always been that children learn a language just by being surrounded by it, so if I find things I like to immerse myself in (and force myself to figure it out myself rather than rely on subtitles), I'll pick it up with a bit of help from textbooks and tutors.  It's worked surprisingly well for me.",

Maybe the Court is actually a new group that has arisen since the drowning of Gotham of people who have exploited the accident to become rich under the guise of privatized charity, and Talons are promising orphans they‚Äôve dedicated a special scholarship for in return for elicit favors. The Owl business is a smoke screen they use to cover up criminal activity with older, unrelated fairytales.

That's what a lot of the big scholarships are about, but I don't have much going on for me except my academics, test scores, and national honor society. How do I approach this?",

        "selftext": "Hi guys, I just wanted to be beacon of hope especially for those who apply on bold.org. For background I'm a rising senior (in college not HS!) And due to some family financial issues, I needed 15k minimum in scholarships for my final year of college or drop out. I applied to over 100 scholarships (25+ of them being bold) and after 3 months and loads of rejections I started to feel hopeless. Bold.org seems really hard to win on as other reddit posts suggests so while at first I simply gave myself a good profile, collected a decent amount of points, I only put minimal effort into the essays. I only applied to bold essays that were matched/very niche for me. So low income, black, female, stem/my major scholarships only. After getting loads of bold rejections I gave up on bold. I actually started ignoring their emails because everytime it would just be a rejection. Until 2 days ago I got an email saying I won a 10k scholarships for low income, 1st gen, BIPOC STEM students in the PNW area (see how niche that is? That leaves me very little competition!). Because I have the bold account/bank card I received the money in that account the next day. It's insane! I started crying because between this and the handful of smaller scholarships I won last week, I don't have to worry about completing my degree anymore. I actually had an outstanding balance on my school account that has been preventing me for registering for Fall classes and I just paid it off! I just want everyone to keep applying....whether it's on bold or elsewhere. So far, I've received 20k in scholarships: 10k from bold.org, 4k from my university's environmental studies department (my major), an undisclosed TBD amount for honors on my campus, $1500 from point foundation, $1500 from my McNair TRIO program on campus, $500 (another TRIO scholarship), $3k Gilman (for my study abroad term). This totals to $20,500! Keep in mind there are dozens and dozens that I still have to hear back from! Let me know if yall need any advice.\n\nedit: won another 1k from my university. officially at $22k winnings. ",

I can pay for the last 3 years full price through my dads gi bill, but there's no way I can pay for the first year of school. I want to go to medical school, and am trying not to graduate with debt in undergrad.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice or experience with trying to get more aid as a middle class kid? Or payment plans while having a job? Private loans are outrageous (11-12% interest unsubsidized...) and I'm not 18 yet so I can't even take out private loans in my own name.\n\nMy only option at this point is to take a gap year and try to delay my committment, which I *really* do not want to do.

If UT is your cheapest option, then taking out a student loan in your own name for 1 years worth of expenses (with the last 3 being free) is a pretty good deal. Many people are funding their whole undergrad through loans. You only need 1 year. It's def do-able. Especially if you know you are a good student and will get to med school. 1 year's of undergrad at a state school will be a drop in the bucket of your entire student loan cost from med school.\n\n2. As others havbe mentioned, ACC for 1 year would be cheaper than UT. That said - are you positive you would be able to transfer after the year into your desired major? That's a big If as well.\n\nUltimately, your parents are already giving you a leg up with 3 years of college paid for. Don't looka  gift horse in the mouth. As you enter adulthood, you now have to make important decisions.",

Then my friends who graduated with no debt started taking out loans to buy new fancy cars and accumulating credit card debt for trips or items that resulted in high-interest payments. \n\nMy education, hard work, and networking helped me land several great, high-paying jobs.

If you are a Texas resident, tuition runs about $500 per hour, and minimum hours to be a full time student is 12 (pretty sure). That is $6000 for a semester or $12,000 for a year. Cheapest traditional housing and dining options will be around $18-20k for the year. That means you need about $32,000. That‚Äôs $3200 per month for 10 months. \n\nFirst, do you have anything to sell? Used car prices are high, books, furniture, clothes, etc all have some value. You got into UT, which means you have some wits about you. Get a traditional job, and work off hours doing something that pays cash. Babysitting over the summer can pay tons, tutoring a subject or teaching a musical instrument can also get you $100-$1000 per week, mow yards, wash windows, clean out trash cans (kids in my neighborhood make a killing charging $20 per house to spray out and clean the city trash bins), wash/detail cars, walk dogs. Whatever you can do, do it. At this point in your life, if you are awake, you should be hustling and making cash. \n\nPut your money in a bank account. Having cash in your mattress is outdated. Having a balance in your checking account shows a bank that you are a good candidate for credit. Learn about credit. It is not the all-evil venue that it is portrayed to be, but you HAVE to use it responsibly.\n\nOnce you get to campus, don‚Äôt stop grinding. Get on payment plans, look into programs for book and supplies aid. Be active in your dorm and get to know your RA/CA. Apply to be an RA/CA in your sophomore year. Many/most RA positions cover room and board. \n\nI‚Äôm not sure if many or any campus jobs are available to freshmen, but I know they are looking for people to work in the IDs department. \n\nFill out the FAFSA paperwork. It is a pain, but federal student aid is available for most. \n\nGrind it out, make it happen. Good luck.",

It‚Äôs just that I felt that statement in my gut, and I‚Äôm so disgusted at how we all expect less fortunate students to ‚Äògrind‚Äô all the time, financially as well as scholastically, while some kids get to coast financially, and sometimes coast scholastically as well. It also didn‚Äôt used to be this way ‚Äî school should be free, in my opinion, not to mention cost of living and the low wages for part-time work ‚Äî so folks who are older than ourselves don‚Äôt ‚Äòremember it being that tough‚Äô and can‚Äôt even fathom the constant pressure and stress. \n\nI appreciate what you‚Äôre doing to encourage OP, but nobody should have to grind that hard ***on top of*** grinding hard for school.

My kids, in college now, will not face such struggles so long as I am living. Biology is unfair to its core, and trying to make it fair is strictly a human trait‚Ä¶maybe our most distinguishing one. \n\nMy mom struggled, and made two things clear to me: Nobody owes you anything, and there is nothing free in this world. Struggle IS part of life, and having a pity party because the privileged few have it ‚Äúso easy‚Äù benefits no one. My grandfather was serving during WW2 in his 20s, and my dad was drafted to the Vietnam War when he was that age. I was happy to be sleeping on American soil.   \n\nI 100% agree with what you say about predatory loans! Understand what makes them predatory is that they offer you comfort by providing more than you absolutely need with terms that seem so beneficial to a young struggling kid. I went on a trip with an old HS friend a few years ago who told me he was still paying off college loans. He borrowed more for college than I used for a down payment on my first house! I thought he had it easy in college, no job, nice apartment, fraternity, parties, all stuff I never did, but he is still paying for it in his 40s! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",

We have found a few on scholarship 360.\n\nBold and scholarship owl are more for small, easy to apply to scholarships .  Because they are small and easy to apply to, they get lots and lots of applications for each one.  It‚Äôs something to do when you have nothing else to apply to, but I wouldn‚Äôt put it as a priority ahead of others.\n\nDefinitely do a lot of googling your major and scholarship.  You will find quite a few scholarships that just aren‚Äôt listed on any of those scholarship search pages.  We have even used ChatGPT to find some although it tends to list the same ones over and over again. Get very creative with your search criteria if you use it and it may find one or two unique ones. \n\nThe biggest thing is to make it a bit of a job.  You need to apply to a lot of places in order to potentially win a few. Remember, everybody is applying for scholarships these days and the easier it is to find or to apply, the more people that apply to it. Things like applications that require multiple recommendations or videos tend to have fewer applicants. So if it‚Äôs hard to apply and it‚Äôs going to take a good amount of your time, it‚Äôs probably worth a try.  It doesn‚Äôt mean you will win them, but your chances are better.  My recommendation is setting aside several days a week where for a couple hours you look for scholarships and or/applied to them.",

These can be used on high-school recruits (of any rank), Graduate Transfers, JUCO players, or Cut Players (in CPR). Visits can be edited IN to your pitch until the recruit closes, but NEVER edited out. This is grounds for automatic disqualification.\n\nAll recruits stop accepting pitches (or edits) at their individual closing time. This closing time occurs when they reach the pre-assigned ‚Äúclose‚Äù time from the sheet, or when they have received no new offers in the last 24 hours, whichever occurs first.\n\nWhen a recruit reaches the final two hours before his closing time from the sheet, he will no longer accept any new offers. Beyond that two-hour mark only existing pitches can be edited.\n\nCopying and pasting pitch content from another pitch, whether your own or someone else‚Äôs, is grounds for disqualification. You may re-use small pieces in multiple pitches, but full sentences (or more) will not be allowed.\n\nAll four-star, five-star, graduate transfer, and JUCO prospects require a scholarship offer. Three-stars, two-stars, one-stars, zero-stars, and Cut Players can be offered walk-on spots or scholarships. Note that a scholarship offer (regardless of pitch quality) always beats a Preferred Walk-on (PWO), which always beats a walk-on offer.\n\nEach team is limited to 8 scholarship players and 13 total players. Signing players beyond these limits will require you to deny commitments or cut players, which may result in loyalty penalties. You should edit your pitch to rescind offers once you fill your desired roster spots. Please make your rescinded offer clear by - at a minimum - adding the word \"RESCINDED\" to the top of your post/reply. You may also strike through the Scholarship and even delete the pitch content, but please do not delete the entire post/reply and do not delete your visits.\n\nOur WIKI Page contains a wealth of information including pitching guides and walkthroughs from some of our most experienced coaches. Please take advantage of this resource.\n\nRemember, it is your responsibility to check the status of the players you offer on the sheet. The sheet is ALWAYS canon, and is the source of truth for a player's position, player's location, player's redshirt status, and more.",

            "body": "Temple offers Jason Drew\n\nScholarship\n\nAs I get up there in age, I think more and more about legacy. What have I done in the three decades since I began coaching that will be remembered three decades from now? There‚Äôs the most obvious one: winning Iowa State its first-ever championship in basketball. But is it enough? For a while, I thought it was, but I wouldn‚Äôt be chatting with you right now if I continued believing that. \n\nNo, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs enough. I‚Äôm proud of what I did with Iowa State, but I believe that I have more to contribute to the basketball world. I know that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre here, too, and I know that‚Äôs why you want to leave a lasting legacy not just in college but in the NBL. I want to help you do that. I want to get you into the NBL repping the cherry and white, and I want you to have a successful career in the NBL just like many of the players I coached with Iowa State have.\n\nIt's only natural that two of the cornerstones of my title-winning ISU team, Terrence Harris and Bostjan Lapornik, would go on to have the greatest careers of any Cyclone in the NBL. They already knew how to win on one of the sport‚Äôs biggest stages. They had won the always-competitive Big Ten Tournament and the National Tournament. They were better prepared than most kids coming out of college for the NBL‚Äôs intense grind, and I‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre just as prepared by having you lead a pro-offense and scheduling as many tough out-of-conference games and in-season tournaments as possible for us.\n\nYou can be the best Owl ever, the face of this program at the professional level, and it‚Äôs strongest advocate when I‚Äôm not here to advocate for the team myself anymore. You can be what Michael Jordan has been for UNC, what Jalen Brunson has been for Villanova, and what Harris and Lapornik have been for Iowa State. I know I can get you into the NBL, but it will be up to you to build your legacy from there, a legacy that I hope will include the words All-Star, All-NBL, and Champion.\n\nYou won‚Äôt have to travel far from your hometown of Janesville, Wisconsin to play for us, either. Since we‚Äôre a Big Ten school, we‚Äôre going to play schools like Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Iowa, so you‚Äôll have plenty of opportunities to return home during conference play.\n\nWe may be new to Division I, but we plan to win a lot of games, including games against big-name schools, during our first season. I‚Äôm going to surround you with elite defenders and shooters so that you can focus on what you do best, which is finding the open man and punishing teams that leave you open.\n\nYou don‚Äôt have to worry about me leaving for another school before I‚Äôve properly prepared you for the next stage of your career because I‚Äôm under contract for the next five years. My loyalty rating of 100 is a source of pride for me, so know that as long as you play for Temple, it will be with me as your coach.\n\nKnow that our prestige will be much higher by the time you leave this school than it is today, as I‚Äôve increased the prestige of every school I‚Äôve coached at. As we win games in the regular season and win CT and NT games, our prestige will rise and continue to rise.\n\nTemple also has a wide selection of majors to ensure that whatever you‚Äôre interested in, you‚Äôll be able to get a degree in it, whether it‚Äôs nuclear physics or dance theater. We also have resources available to ensure that even when you‚Äôre playing, you aren‚Äôt going to struggle in class at all. Our goal is to get you into the NBL, but if you do end up staying the four years or return later to get your degree, it will be worth something, and it will let you follow any dream you have.\n\nHope to talk to you again,\n\nCoach Jicem",

Write three 1000 word essays on volunteering, how you will help your community, and how a personal growth incident or story helped you decide what you want to do or will help you in college/the future.  Be as specific as possible about the stories, who you are, your activities.  Those three essays will fit 90% of your applications.  The jury is still out on ChatGPT so that's something you'll have to decide yourself.  You can certainly use it to expand or compress down to 500 words your essays and then rewrite.  Those scholarship platforms can seem scammy at first but keep digging into them, play around with your profile (which filters scholarship matches for you) and key word searches.  Look at all of the aggregators and dig into them and go up the learning curve.  Be prepared to do some short videos instead of essays but you can use ChatGPT to write a script for you.  Create a new email address just for applications.\n\nAlso, there's nothing wrong with loans and you are guaranteed $5500 a year in federal subsidized loans assuming your parents have good credit.  You can take additional loans as well based on need.  I understand student loan debt is a problem but if you take them and your income seriously they are manageable.  Some institutions or businesses will pay them off for you.  Consider federal government employment, despite the current environment for that.  Student loan repayment is often a benefit in public service.\n\nUniversity seems like a difficult thing to pay for but it isn't if you work hard and do your research.  Go to a state university.  Unless you are going to a top 50 private university there is no point going to a private university and paying extra for lifestyle or academics.  Many state schools are top tier as well.\n\nAlso, there are a TON of scholarships specifically for first gen students.",

            "body": "That may have been the case when OWL ended, but many of the next generation of NA players (Tr33, Vega, Cjay, Zeruhh, Infekted, Haven, etc) that were mostly playing in Contenders when OWL ended, are making things work with the new poverty wages/winnings structure by taking advantage of a combination of collegiate and OWCS. For many, it is the first time they have access to a structured program with dedicated coaching and facilities. Training with ex-OWL players in collegiate also helps mentor the younger players.\n\nBlizzard should want Collegiate to succeed as the de facto Contenders league. It is effectively subsidizing OWCS and represents a path to pro for young players who don‚Äôt have wealthy parents, and sets them up to succeed post-OWCS by giving them access to an education. That gives younger players that are right now in middle and HS something to aspire to that is actually viable.\n\nIf all the big collegiate OW programs that offered scholarship support shutter their programs due to Blizzard‚Äôs lack of support and/or shortsightedness, the esport will collapse in NA. What orgs would want to stay involved? What players could afford to compete? Already the #3 team in the world only got $26K after all their hard work in Stage 1. And do you know what supported those players when they weren‚Äôt on a partnered team? They were all collegiate players.\n\nBlizzard seems like they are really making some great changes and are working hard to pivot to make OWCS successful, but it seems like they really dropped the ball on Collegiate this year with disastrous results.",

Write three 1000 word essays on volunteering, how you will help your community, and how a personal growth incident or story helped you decide what you want to do or will help you in college/the future.  Be as specific as possible about the stories, who you are, your activities.  Those three essays will fit 90% of your applications.  The jury is still out on ChatGPT so that's something you'll have to decide yourself.  You can certainly use it to expand or compress down to 500 words your essays and then rewrite.  Those scholarship platforms can seem scammy at first but keep digging into them, play around with your profile (which filters scholarship matches for you) and key word searches.  Look at all of the aggregators and dig into them and go up the learning curve.  Be prepared to do some short videos instead of essays but you can use ChatGPT to write a script for you.  Create a new email address just for applications.\n\nAlso, there's nothing wrong with loans and you are guaranteed $5500 a year in federal subsidized loans assuming your parents have good credit.  You can take additional loans as well based on need.  I understand student loan debt is a problem but if you take them and your income seriously they are manageable.  Some institutions or businesses will pay them off for you.  Consider federal government employment, despite the current environment for that.  Student loan repayment is often a benefit in public service.\n\nUniversity seems like a difficult thing to pay for but it isn't if you work hard and do your research.  Go to a state university.  Unless you are going to a top 50 private university there is no point going to a private university and paying extra for lifestyle or academics.  Many state schools are top tier as well.\n\nA 3.7 unweighted GPA is very good.  If you have strong extra curriculars that's enough to get you into a top 20 university (like UVA for benchmark purposes because that's a uni I know), assuming you are taking mostly AP or IB courses to get you over 4.0 in your weighted GPA.\n\nAlso, do NOT do worse your first senior year semester.  Do better.  Universities like to see improvememt.  For real.  So if you get straight As your Fall semester you are golden.",

        "selftext": "Im 18, my sisters are 25 and 28. Growing up my mom (single mom, immigrant)expected less of me in regards to chores and responsibilities so in 2020 my sisters pulled away from responsibilities in the house entirely and since turning 16 I have recognized how unfair it and was and have completed built my own independence. I don't ask for rides, money and clean after myself and help my mom with legit everything. The dynamic has completely flipped to where everything in the house falls on me, which I am relatively fine with if it means my sisters can work on their personal life that has been hindered by the years they spent sacrificing for me. But me and my 26 y/o sister shared a room up until 2 years ago after we both tried the basement but ended up hating it because of the bugs. My sisters had their own rooms and I really hated the idea of sharing again. She suggested I temporarily make a room out of the walk in closet, which I agreed to. For a year I have been staying here with only my twin bed and nightstand and clothes. Neither of them have real plans of moving out I'm pretty sure. \n\nThe closet is connected to the only working shower by sliding door. When they shower they blast their music for usually an hour. The first time I asked for them to turn it down, my 28 y/o sister asked \"do you have somewhere to go tmrw morning?\" insinuating she doesn't wanna turn it down. Then another time my 25 y/o sister asked to unplug my lamp for her speaker and charger and I said \"no id be in the dark\" she said \"you can't be in the dark for 15 minutes?\" another example is when I was conflicted on my career choices my 28 y/o sister said \"well I feel like you have many options considering mom doesn't expect things from you\" or \"you\"ll be fine you don't have responsibilities anyway\" meanwhile months later I'm handling big things like our fridge being broke, figuring out dealerships for a new car, cleaning after them, while in nursing school. My mom also notices their rebellion so she solely asks me for help which is annoying but I sort of understand not asking people who don't want to help you. When I talk to other people in my life they think I'm insane for letting them say stuff like that to me but I really do feel sorry for the way the grew up because it affects their life now (no car, no friend groups, no husbands) so sometimes I'm okay with being a trauma punching bag ykwim? But lately the closet life is really getting to me between the stress of school and family, coming home to twin bed in closet feels like cinderella lol. I feel like they have gotten so comfortable with me doing everything in the house, while I deal with my own life and having no real bedroom that they justify being really ungrateful or invalidating towards me. It is really affecting my own mental health to stay in a closet but I am scared of their reaction.",

            "body": "# Interesting Takeaways Part 1 - About Joe Marsh &amp; T1\n\n**E-Sports as a Career**\n\n* **Breaking into the Industry:** Joe Marsh transitioned was unplanned from traditional comcast sports marketing intern to esports in 2017, joining Philadelphia Fusion OWL Team\n* **Investing in Talent:** T1 focuses on developing talent through initiatives like the Faker Scholarship. Modern esports players are treated like professional athletes, with dedicated physical therapists, mental coaches, and nutrition plans to optimize performance.\n* **Content Creation Challenges:** Pro players are often not natural content creators. Teams need to carefully manage storytelling and trust between players and content staff to produce engaging material.\n\n# T1 @ Worlds\n\n* **DDoS Issues:** Persistent DDoS attacks disrupted T1‚Äôs solo queue and fan interaction, affecting their income and preparation. Marsh criticized the lack of solutions to this problem.\n* **Zeus‚Äô Departure and Doran's Welcome:** T1 was committed to re-signing Zeus, but when that didn‚Äôt work out, they quickly pivoted to Doran. Marsh praised Doran‚Äôs work ethic and willingness to embrace T1‚Äôs high-pressure culture.\n* **Faker‚Äôs Longevity:** Faker continues to redefine expectations of player longevity, performing at an elite level well into his late 20s, defying the notion that esports players peak in their early 20s.\n* **Worlds as the Pinnacle:** Marsh noted that winning Worlds has the highest value in esports, not just financially but for legacy. Other tournaments, even MSI, don‚Äôt hold the same weight.\n* **Post-Match Bonding:** T1 emphasizes team dinners and bonding moments during competitions to build trust and reduce stress, with Haidilao dinners\n\n# Fan Engagement &amp; Branding\n\n* **Lifestyle Branding:** T1 has evolved beyond just a competitive team to a lifestyle brand with a focus on merchandise, fan platforms, and academy programs. Before Marsh‚Äôs tenure, fans couldn‚Äôt even purchase a T1 jersey. The team now has a robust merchandise strategy that includes partnerships and in-house products.\n* **Female Fandom:** \\*\\*\\*\"\\*\\*\\**You know, 85% of our venue was filled at our home game by our female fans. They support with their wallets, like they come out and force.\"* A significant portion of T1‚Äôs fanbase is female, which Marsh sees as a strength for live events and merchandise sales.\n* [Celebrating Players as Stars:](https://revoldiv.com/posts/f6160800-29e0-483e-a719-9898e4d9ec0b?time_to_highlight=00:16:02.08) Marsh emphasized the importance of treating players like celebrities, particularly in Korea, where they are viewed as cultural icons.\n* **Expanding Globally:** *\"We'd love to get at least 10 more in Korea in relatively short order, and then take that throughout Southeast Asia, whether it's Japan, Vietnam, Philippines, Singapore\"*\n\n# Gameplay &amp; Competition\n\n* **Meta vs. Playstyle:** T1 deliberately crafts strategies that align with their players‚Äô strengths rather than chasing global metas, which Marsh credits for their consistent success.\n* **The Guma-Keria Partnership:** Marsh praised Gumayusi and Keria‚Äôs synergy, emphasizing their unique ability to adapt and excel even when resources are scarce. Gumayusi‚Äôs mental resilience was highlighted as an essential factor for T1‚Äôs success, particularly when dealing with limited resources in high-pressure matches.\n* **Team Chemistry:** Marsh noted that championship teams are built through time, consistency, and trust, not just by signing the most talented players.\n* **Early Mistakes**: Initial 10-man roster strategy was challenging but helped identify top talent like Gumayusi, Keria, and Zeus",

Joe Marsh on LCK Cup**\n\n Joe Marsh also shared his¬†[thoughts¬†](https://youtu.be/M97E6oGP-nU?si=QifOXsmZ3Sy8ispU&amp;t=1140)(19:00) on¬†**LCK Cup**\n\n&gt;\n\n[full quote](https://youtu.be/M97E6oGP-nU?si=ptteWFYuCBNkTwbq&amp;t=2738)¬†(45:30) on competing in¬†**LCK Cup**\n\n&gt;\n\n**2. Esports Salaries and sustainability**\n\n‚ÄúThe average LCK salary in 2019 was $36,000 USD. That‚Äôs now ballooned to around half a million dollars.‚Äù\n\n**3. Issues with NA Esports Infrastructure**\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too expensive to live and operate in California. You‚Äôd find it cheaper to fly people to event destinations than to keep everyone in Santa Monica and pay California rates.‚Äù\n\n**4. Shift Toward International Formats (Key Highlight for me!)**\n\n‚ÄúEveryone cares about Worlds. Nobody wants to see T1 beating the bottom four LCK teams for months on end. Shrink the number of teams and focus on more international events.‚Äù\n\n\\- Joe Marsh proposed a shift from a locked regional play to a more global circuit structure, similar to **tennis or golf.** [(my own take on circuit style)](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1h6k90s/comment/m0f9r7d/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n**5. Creator-Led Teams Can Revitalize Esports**\n\n‚ÄúI also think this is my probably unpopular opinion, I think the creator led teams is super good for the game with Kameto and Karmine, what Caedrel is doing with Los Ratones and what Ludwig and Tyler1 could do with teams is great for the game‚Äôs health. They bring eyeballs and built-in audiences. ‚Äù\n\n**6. The Power of Fandom**\n\n‚ÄúDRX won Worlds, and they disbanded the next year. Winning isn‚Äôt enough. You need a fandom to support you afterward.‚Äù\n\n**7. Fixing Content Creation in Esports**\n\n‚ÄúContent for content‚Äôs sake doesn‚Äôt work. Just rolling cameras isn‚Äôt telling a story. Behind-the-scenes content and voice comms are what fans want‚Äîbut those are the hardest to produce because players and coaches don‚Äôt want to give away secrets.‚Äù\n\n**8. Esports Needs a New Talent Development Model**\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôd partner with colleges and build a feeder system, treating it like NCAA sports. Players could live in dorms, play, and study under scholarships.‚Äù",

Staying below that is advised.)`\n\n     Most stable on Series S/X.\nOne S w/o a SSD might have occasional frame drops due to low VRAM `(which is easily solved by restarting the console)`, otherwise all three run it flawlessly.\n\n**SE is advised.** *AE versions/patches for most mods here exist - if you are struggling to find one, let me know by commenting, I'll help!*\n\n‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã\n\n**ALL** Skyrim aspects overhauled or changed to a degree in a lore-accepted, well balanced way.\n\nNo enormous world changes that might veer far from the conceptual essence `The Elder Scrolls V` carries.\n\n   Instead, space has been made to bring a **FRESH** smell to the air with the **significant** parts within this mod list;\n\n   ..mods redoing all known gameplay elements, adding weapons, armor, revamping unique items, giving access to new followers abiding by a better framework, expanding &amp; adding quest lines, revisiting popular areas, enhancing atmospherics...\n\n           ..in short summary..\n\n   ..**Extended Encounters** &amp; **Radiance** to bring an adventurous (risky, perhaps?) sense to your travels,\n\n   ..**DAWN V2**, **Wildlands Renewal** *with* **Nature of the Wild Lands**, **LUX, LUX Via &amp; Orbis**, **City Trees AiO** &amp; **Flagrantly Plagerized Graphics Overhaul** *with* some **tailored LoD** to bring more beauty,\n\n   ..**Open World Loot** &amp; other *perfectly* sewn together leveled lists/encounter zones to let the progression &amp; world feeling be more organic..\n\n   ..**CFPAO**, **ESCO**, **GDB'S: Elden Beast Edition** and various enemy overhauls paired in compatibility and consistency to form a marvelous &amp; modular all-in-one animation, combat, movement, enemy AI, loot.. *AND MORE*.. rework.\n\n   ..a total &amp; EPIC dragon remake (God knows we needed that..),\n\n   an audio `(Dolby Atmos supported)` &amp; music `(Norse inspired)` retouch to let the provincial climate seep through your expensive sound system on a scale grander than before,\n\n   **Skyrim Reputation**, **Wintersun**..\n\n   AND SO, SO MUCH MORE! Don't worry, \n     quests have been touched too, \n           **extensively.**\n\n   ~                                 \n\nAll in all, all elements have been furthered in extensive ways, all while keeping Skyrim true to its concepts.\n\n   ..still nostalgic.. but SUPER FRESH, more playable &amp; immersive to boot? WHERE DO I SIGN UP!?\n\nIncludes **Racial Body Morphs**, **Modular Clothing System**, **Sos Ahst Mulaag** &amp; **Serendipitous** paired with **No Pain, No Gain**, which, combined and patched with other carefully selected mods here, makes for a character development overhaul that truly makes you feel more like you're playing a real roleplaying game.\n\n   You decide what you want to be, no more **\"Jack of All Trades\"**, now it's time to step into your *DREAM* build. Paladin/archer &amp; enchanter? Destructive `(as destructive as a combination of Odin, Triumvirate &amp; Kittytail's best spell selection can make one)` steel-clad mage with an affinity for smithing? A menacing vampire using **ancient blood magic**? A **brutal** WEREBEAST? All while keeping that **DRIP INTACT?**\n\n   ## The possibilities have no end, but so don't the consequences. Your choices matter. Choose wisely.\n\n   ~\n\nConstructive criticism on this beautiful list is always appreciated &amp; loved! See something and think it's changeable/furtherable in a positive direction? Tell me!\n\n**Extra care has been taken to avoid community-wide known problematic mods with dirty edits or unwanted changes.**\n\n*MASSIVE thanks &amp; kudos to the brothers &amp; sisters in the community who helped with this! I posted the relevant community links in the comments.*\n\n**Total stability ensues..!**\n\n‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã=‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè\n\nIf you're one with the beautiful people installing it, make sure that you download the mods from the biggest to the smallest, until you reach ones that are below 1 MB. All creation downloads on Xbox require DOUBLE space to queue, hence why. `(This is important with this modlist, as it takes up almost all 5 GB.)`\n\n   **To do so, confer with this download order here:**\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t_Vw87fWuc0tKNbr8-xY9q3_w68eJI-d_QAIL2Bpajc/edit?usp=drivesdk\n\n`(ALTERNATIVELY, you can do the following; first clear your Bethnet library completely, add 70 (limit) mods starting from the top o' the download order document, go to the in-game Creations menu and hit \"Download all Creations from my library\" and download the rest manually, or do the same as above until you have everything installed - this speeds up the process significantly, if you do it fast enough.)`\n\n   ~\n\n### If not, here are some pointers;\n\n..when downloading, disable the mod you just installed before moving on to the next. Enable all one by one later, from top to bottom, in the load order menu when you finish reordering them **while offline** according to the *load order document.* This practice will prevent most of decreasing engine stability and lessen crashes as the plugin count comes into the upper 150s.\n\n*When searching for a mod, only search for one word related to it.* **Why?** The Bethnet search engine searches for all mods attributed to all words you enter as a query.\n\nDon't be afraid when your game crashes or you get a *\"Can't connect to servers\"* error. Both are safe ~ when it crashes, simply reopen Skyrim.\n\n   **Refer here for a full guide on how to go offline and order correctly &amp; more general advice**;\n\n   https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyrimModsXbox/comments/1iiyp23/repost_general_xbox_modding_advice_thread_for_you/\n\n   ~\n\nMake sure to look down in the comments for a subthread compiling all recent changes/updates to the load order!

Sorry to hear your situation, try reaching out to your school to ask for emergency grants too etc. I once asked for an additional increase and was rejected, then I tried again and rewrote another email and was granted an increase.

Which was quite less as no university covers the exact syllabus of NET ENGLISH. \nFor a year I was juggling between books YouTube channels and online free education if available. But no use. \nI had a very old college professor who died recently I asked him for help \nHe made me a list of few books and also provided some second hand books. \nI stared reading it specially in night as I m a night owl and it helps me think. \nFirst reading was only to understand what the hell is this all about. From second I started minimising the data but never burdened my brain that I have to learn it all. Soon I was able to recall and understand. Then once the notes were made made a time table to JUST CASUALLY read it every Third day. \nBrain feels scared and burdened until it‚Äôs unfamiliar with the data. Once you started giving it the data every few days it becomes habitual. \nThen I solved the PYQS again and this time brain just knew how to eliminate the wrong. \nAnd that led to correct answer. \nPlus I started to understand from where the questions are coming from. \nThe I started my serious revision thinking let‚Äôs polish the knowledge and started learning in 1 hr cycle and 10 mints break in which I used CHATGPT to make MCQS for me In 4 stages -easy- moderate- difficult- ultra difficult \n\nI trained my brain for 7-8 months and appeared for first NET and qualified for PHD only as some marks were less in scoring NET \nAt that time I also knew what I m lacking and stared studying theory and criticism. Then I was more confident. This time the paper was too difficult but the previous study and the theory criticism helped me a lot. \nNow I have to focus on linguistic üòÖ \nI want to do PhD and I need scholarship for that. That is the only reason for my success in this exam. I can‚Äôt afford private institutions and I bloody need a scholarship üòÖ",

All I really want is a cozy college with a great student life in a nice town and I feel like that's been kinda hard to find. Really need one with mid/high acceptance rates too :/\n\nSome colleges I've *somewhat* been considering include CU Boulder and Appalachian State. If you can't tell I really like pretty views and don't wanna be in a gross insanely modern college.\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions or can share any knowledge about colleges that fit that description, please please please let me know!\n\n\nEDIT : thanks to everybody that responded!! for the people commenting about my budget, not gonna get too in detail about it but it's hard to say an exact number because my parents are separated and one has a very high income and one is literally completely broke. I'm moving in with the higher income one who lives in NC next summer who has some money saved up for me, just don't know how much so plspls dont give me a hard time about it :(\n\nThanks again!!",

            "body": "It‚Äôs legitimate, but I‚Äôd recommend applying for scholarships that are more specialized and have less people applying for them to maximize your chances. I must have applied for at least 50 scholarships through a scholarship program and not gotten one. \n\nBut as for what I‚Äôd recommend applying for... find things that set you apart from a large number of people and use them. They don‚Äôt have to be individual characteristics. \n\nFor example, a lot of companies offer scholarships to their clients or their clients‚Äô kids. That includes banks, phone companies, power companies, etc. The pool will be smaller and more specialized, so you‚Äôll have a better shot at it. If you‚Äôre in high school, see if your county offers scholarships for juniors/ seniors (I got one through my school‚Äôs PTSA). \n\nAlso look for societies that support your major, as they might offer scholarships. For example, I‚Äôm in aerospace engineering, so I go after scholarships from the National Business Aviation Association, Vertical Flight Society, Society of Women Engineers, etc. Look for them on a state and national level. An incredible bonus of these is that they are so, so good for networking, and in my experience they try to look after their scholarship recipients (set you up with company higher-ups, invite you to conferences, etc.). They don‚Äôt just throw money at you and leave you in the dust. If you‚Äôre looking for an internship or a recommendation from someone in the industry, those connections can be incredible. \n\nIf you‚Äôre a dependent of a veteran or someone on active duty, I believe that there are a bunch of scholarships that you would qualify for (I haven‚Äôt looked into that so much because I‚Äôm not). Additionally, if you‚Äôre any kind of minority in your field, such as a Hispanic planning to major in STEM, there is a good chance that there are scholarships for you. Same with first generation students. \n\nIf you are an American citizen, depending on your major, you could also check out the DoD‚Äôs scholarships.\n\nAnything that you can think of that applies to you, but doesn‚Äôt apply to everyone, is a good bet. \n\nI‚Äôm really sorry for the wall of text. Overall, while free scholarship search engines are legitimate, there are so many people on them that you‚Äôre unlikely to receive anything. So, those are some alternatives. They payed off for me so much more than the multiple scholarship search engines I used, so I thought that I‚Äôd share them. Good luck!\n\nOut of curiosity, what‚Äôs your major?\n\n",

They are a tool and can be helpful if used as such. Each one has scholarships that are only found on their site, and some are definitely better than others. \n\nDON'T ignore local scholarships for national ones. You are much more likely to win the locals. Less competition. One scholarship my son entered had 22,000+ applicants last year (he's still in the running for that one).

My son rarely did the no essay scholarships.\n\nI like:\nScholarships.com\n\nScholarship360\n\nFastweb\n\nScholarship America\n\nKaleidescope\n\nJLV Counseling Scholarships\n\nDiscover has a huge list\n\nGoing Merry\n\nTUN Scholarships\n\nEmail: Monica Matthews has a monthly list-also has an excellent ebook to walk you through the process\n\nEmail: Dave the Scholarship Coach has a daily scholarship-does essay review and is putting out an excellent video course-Scholarship GPS.\n\nAlso, check professional organizations related to your major. They give huge discounts to students and many times have scholarships available only to members. My son won one of these, and they also offered him mentorship with people in their industry, networking, and help navigating college for 2 years.",

Check utility companies and local businesses like hospitals, lawyers, churches, etc. Check websites from area high schools. Check past students that you know got scholarships and Google scholarships + their name. My son got scholarships from all of these searches.\n\nMy son has won 14 scholarships, although he's applied to 90:\n\n6 local through the high school\n\n2 through our phone/internet company\n\n2 regional (means they cover multiple counties)\n\n1 through his college\n\n2 state specific\n\n1 through a professional organization.\n\nOne of the local scholarships was through a community foundation. The professional organization also provides a free 1 year membership, mentoring for 2 years and help finding internships. No, he didn't have a membership when he applied, but now that he's in college, he will get memberships (they're usually free or cheap - $20)\n\nEssays: There are several areas to focus on: academics, leadership, volunteering, work, and extra curriculars. You should work on building things in all, but my opinion is to focus on volunteering. That is most students' weakest area. Make it quality, and try to do stuff that line up with your goals. The goal is to make all the individual areas into a cohesive story.\n\nWhen it comes to actually applying to scholarships, essays are going to be key. Having good test scores, high GPA, and class ranking will help, but a lot of students have that. Your essay is how you will stand out. Write what I call the 'Why Education' essay. What you want to major in, what led you to that, what you did in life (in school and outside of school) to move that direction, what your plans are for college, what your plans are for after college and how you will help the community or world with your degree. Make it passionate and personal, and if you have to overcome anything, include that. Make your essay a story others want to read. You can use versions of this essay for 90% of the scholarships you will apply to.\n\nTwo paid for recommendations that aren't a lot of $ but will help you, are Dave with Scholarship GPS-he has a video course, and Monica Matthews-she has an ebook. I highly recommend both.",

Coca-Cola. Look in your school website and see if they have some foundations listed.\n\nThis is important if you for sure know where you are going to college dive into their website. Start looking for deadlines for the Merit and base need those dates are early and most of the time you have to apply to those now in sept to dec. If you do not see the college scholarships site, call financial aid office.\n\nLook for volleyball scholarships. Look for general major (any major eligible) scholarships and search by your major too. Talk to your school counselor about your plan sometimes they have scholarships only for students attending that school only. Look into your state Department of Higer Education they have resources there too. Complete your FAFSA by November some scholarships ask for those details. Prepare a resume and start writing essays later you can revise again. Finaly, on Google type your town and scholarship foundation, your state and scholarship foundation. Ask if your parent employer offer scholarships for the employees' children.\n\nMake the list!",

I was recently awarded a **$1,000 scholarship** for graduate students after applying through the platform ‚Äî so it can absolutely work. That said, this resource might not be for everyone. If you‚Äôre highly self-organized and already know where to look, the value may be less significant.\n\nAlways weigh the cost vs. benefit based on your scholarship goals and bandwidth.",

Which was quite less as no university covers the exact syllabus of NET ENGLISH. \nFor a year I was juggling between books YouTube channels and online free education if available. But no use. \nI had a very old college professor who died recently I asked him for help \nHe made me a list of few books and also provided some second hand books. \nI stared reading it specially in night as I m a night owl and it helps me think. \nFirst reading was only to understand what the hell is this all about. From second I started minimising the data but never burdened my brain that I have to learn it all. Soon I was able to recall and understand. Then once the notes were made made a time table to JUST CASUALLY read it every Third day. \nBrain feels scared and burdened until it‚Äôs unfamiliar with the data. Once you started giving it the data every few days it becomes habitual. \nThen I solved the PYQS again and this time brain just knew how to eliminate the wrong. \nAnd that led to correct answer. \nPlus I started to understand from where the questions are coming from. \nThe I started my serious revision thinking let‚Äôs polish the knowledge and started learning in 1 hr cycle and 10 mints break in which I used CHATGPT to make MCQS for me In 4 stages -easy- moderate- difficult- ultra difficult \n\nI trained my brain for 7-8 months and appeared for first NET and qualified for PHD only as some marks were less in scoring NET \nAt that time I also knew what I m lacking and stared studying theory and criticism. Then I was more confident. This time the paper was too difficult but the previous study and the theory criticism helped me a lot. \nNow I have to focus on linguistic üòÖ \nI want to do PhD and I need scholarship for that. That is the only reason for my success in this exam. I can‚Äôt afford private institutions and I bloody need a scholarship üòÖ",

They give huge discounts to students and many times have scholarships available only to members. My son won one of these, and they also offered him mentorship with people in their industry, networking, and help navigating college for 2 years.\n\nConsider looking at all options for college. My son is going to community college for $13,000/year and will be able to receive a $4,000/year transfer scholarship. That is 2 years at more than half the cost of the university. If you don't have to, don't spend $100,000 on a degree.",

        "selftext": "Hi guys, I just wanted to be beacon of hope especially for those who apply on bold.org. For background I'm a rising senior (in college not HS!) And due to some family financial issues, I needed 15k minimum in scholarships for my final year of college or drop out. I applied to over 100 scholarships (25+ of them being bold) and after 3 months and loads of rejections I started to feel hopeless. Bold.org seems really hard to win on as other reddit posts suggests so while at first I simply gave myself a good profile, collected a decent amount of points, I only put minimal effort into the essays. I only applied to bold essays that were matched/very niche for me. So low income, black, female, stem/my major scholarships only. After getting loads of bold rejections I gave up on bold. I actually started ignoring their emails because everytime it would just be a rejection. Until 2 days ago I got an email saying I won a 10k scholarships for low income, 1st gen, BIPOC STEM students in the PNW area (see how niche that is? That leaves me very little competition!). Because I have the bold account/bank card I received the money in that account the next day. It's insane! I started crying because between this and the handful of smaller scholarships I won last week, I don't have to worry about completing my degree anymore. I actually had an outstanding balance on my school account that has been preventing me for registering for Fall classes and I just paid it off! I just want everyone to keep applying....whether it's on bold or elsewhere. So far, I've received 20k in scholarships: 10k from bold.org, 4k from my university's environmental studies department (my major), an undisclosed TBD amount for honors on my campus, $1500 from point foundation, $1500 from my McNair TRIO program on campus, $500 (another TRIO scholarship), $3k Gilman (for my study abroad term). This totals to $20,500! Keep in mind there are dozens and dozens that I still have to hear back from! Let me know if yall need any advice.\n\nedit: won another 1k from my university. officially at $22k winnings. ",

I did attempt it in 2020 with Duolingo for about a month (French), but I returned back to work from furlough leave much quicker than expected, so gave it up.\n\nEven in school, I was just an average student when it came to exams for my own language (English) and instead, was better at things like Math and Science.\n\nI am asking on this sub, as I have read that learning a second language can be one of the hardest things to do for someone with ADHD.\n\nAnyone tried?

Taught myself Japanese in high school then picked up a scholarship to do a year's exchange there (came back fluent), my high school had been teaching Chinese so then I focused on that and got a scholarship a few years later to study in Taiwan (am now fluent).  Learnt a bit of Greek when I was living in Cyprus and picked it up really quickly (alas, I've forgotten it all now as this all happened over about a year only) and now I'm in London so working on my French with DuoLingo and finding it pretty helpful (but what the FUCK is French?  People always come at me when I say Japanese is easy but look, once you get over the squiggles it's fine. It makes sense. It's repetetive, there are rules, there are no real exemptions.  What the *fuck* is French???)\n\nI would say that Japanese grammar is rather mathematical to me (I was learning HTML at the time and thought it was quite similar).  I find maths easier when I think of it as a language rather than...idk. Maths?\n\n\nAnyway, as a trade off, I'm absolutely shit at anything to do with my hands.  My handwriting is atrocious. I cannot learn a craft to save my life. I love to cook, but I get really good at cooking dishes, then don't cook it for a while and completely forget everything about the process. \n\n\nBut then -- I don't make crafty things a habit.  When I'm learning a language properly, I'll listen to the music, pick up some workbooks for basic grammar and stuff but focus on having a tutor and finding media in that language.  Some people are great at learning with flashcards but that just makes it too much like hard work to me -- I need to find stuff I like and engage with it on the daily (my french has fallen off a cliff since I stopped watching ladybug, even though I still do my duo to keep the murder owl happy). My thinking has always been that children learn a language just by being surrounded by it, so if I find things I like to immerse myself in (and force myself to figure it out myself rather than rely on subtitles), I'll pick it up with a bit of help from textbooks and tutors.  It's worked surprisingly well for me.",

        "selftext": "The first movie was more about corruption of government and stuff, and I believe the later movies will dive deep into these subjects but if they Include court of owls then the movies will change from being about corruption of government to being about some conspiracy, illuminati stuff and I don't think they will go into such direction because such stuff about secret organizations who manipulate the city weren't hinted in the first movie and if they add such stuff in the later movies, it won't be a clever plot twist. So yeah adding them will completely change the narrative. Some conspiracy theorist will love it lol and the idea is cool but it shouldn't and will not be included in these movies. Maybe for some other movies, but not in these. And if they do add such stuff, I would still watch and enjoy them but will feel disappointed because I expected something else.",

The Court is not comparable to the Riddler because he has existed for around 50 years and has dozens of stories and interpretations while they have one. There is one Court story, and they are very rigidly defined.\n\nOf course Reeves can reimagine them however he wants, but in that case what are you championing? Sure maybe he takes the idea and turns into something not redundant, boring, and thematically fruitless, but then it‚Äôs not the thing are talking about anymore so who cares? Maybe the Court is actually a new group that has arisen since the drowning of Gotham of people who have exploited the accident to become rich under the guise of privatized charity, and Talons are promising orphans they‚Äôve dedicated a special scholarship for in return for elicit favors. The Owl business is a smoke screen they use to cover up criminal activity with older, unrelated fairytales. They are about how disaster is exploited, corporations use charity to better themselves, and indirectly for the coercive nature of military recruitment. If I had to use this property, that would be my pitch. Would that work for you?",

Will it make sense for my 18 and 16 year old to apply for most of the same scholarships as my 18 year old?\n\nWhen my oldest son accepted his college invite last week, the school provided a long checklist of things we need to do. Some are time sensitive, so we know to do those first. \nBut that college checklist was the straw to break my emotional back. üòµ‚Äçüí´üòµü§Øüò≥ü•∫üò¢...It dawned on me that even after the check off list is complete, how much will still need to be done to get him ready for college.

What recommendations do you have for the important things to deal with regarding school, scholarships, preparing for dorm life, etc. And what have you learned could wait or doesn't really need to be dealt with?

My advice is to take it one thing at a time. Be present in the moments that are happening (end of year Sr stuff, graduation). You can still have a restful summer.

Also, note that while some of these are databases, not all databases are the same. Everything listed I personally used for my son.\n\nMass applying will be exhausting and unfruitful. Focus on writing good essays; get someone to check them, and focus on applying to scholarships that fit you.\n\nI don't like Bold or ScholarshipOwl, and my son rarely did the no essay scholarships.\n\nI like:\nScholarships.com\n\nScholarship360\n\nFastweb\n\nScholarship America\n\nKaleidescope\n\nJLV Counseling Scholarships\n\nDiscover has a huge list\n\nGoing Merry\n\nTUN Scholarships\n\nEmail: Monica Matthews has a monthly list-also has an excellent ebook to walk you through the process\n\nEmail: Dave the Scholarship Coach at Scholarship GPS has a daily scholarship-does essay review and has an excellent video course. \n\nAlso, check professional organizations related to your major. They give huge discounts to students and many times have scholarships available only to members. My son won one of these, and they also offered him mentorship with people in their industry, networking, and help navigating college for 2 years.",

        "selftext": "Hi guys, I just wanted to be beacon of hope especially for those who apply on bold.org. For background I'm a rising senior (in college not HS!) And due to some family financial issues, I needed 15k minimum in scholarships for my final year of college or drop out. I applied to over 100 scholarships (25+ of them being bold) and after 3 months and loads of rejections I started to feel hopeless. Bold.org seems really hard to win on as other reddit posts suggests so while at first I simply gave myself a good profile, collected a decent amount of points, I only put minimal effort into the essays. I only applied to bold essays that were matched/very niche for me. So low income, black, female, stem/my major scholarships only. After getting loads of bold rejections I gave up on bold. I actually started ignoring their emails because everytime it would just be a rejection. Until 2 days ago I got an email saying I won a 10k scholarships for low income, 1st gen, BIPOC STEM students in the PNW area (see how niche that is? That leaves me very little competition!). Because I have the bold account/bank card I received the money in that account the next day. It's insane! I started crying because between this and the handful of smaller scholarships I won last week, I don't have to worry about completing my degree anymore. I actually had an outstanding balance on my school account that has been preventing me for registering for Fall classes and I just paid it off! I just want everyone to keep applying....whether it's on bold or elsewhere. So far, I've received 20k in scholarships: 10k from bold.org, 4k from my university's environmental studies department (my major), an undisclosed TBD amount for honors on my campus, $1500 from point foundation, $1500 from my McNair TRIO program on campus, $500 (another TRIO scholarship), $3k Gilman (for my study abroad term). This totals to $20,500! Keep in mind there are dozens and dozens that I still have to hear back from! Let me know if yall need any advice.\n\nedit: won another 1k from my university. officially at $22k winnings. ",

If UT is your cheapest option, then taking out a student loan in your own name for 1 years worth of expenses (with the last 3 being free) is a pretty good deal. Many people are funding their whole undergrad through loans. You only need 1 year. It's def do-able. Especially if you know you are a good student and will get to med school. 1 year's of undergrad at a state school will be a drop in the bucket of your entire student loan cost from med school.\n\n2. As others havbe mentioned, ACC for 1 year would be cheaper than UT. That said - are you positive you would be able to transfer after the year into your desired major? That's a big If as well.\n\nUltimately, your parents are already giving you a leg up with 3 years of college paid for. Don't looka  gift horse in the mouth. As you enter adulthood, you now have to make important decisions.",

Then my friends who graduated with no debt started taking out loans to buy new fancy cars and accumulating credit card debt for trips or items that resulted in high-interest payments. \n\nMy education, hard work, and networking helped me land several great, high-paying jobs. My loans are now paid off (prioritized paying ones with higher interest first). I have substantial equity in a +million dollar, 4K sqft home and about $2M in investments. I have always had good jobs because of my degree from UT Austin. If you tap into your talents and leverage your resources and personal connections, you'll do great. The first step is getting accepted. Congrats and good luck!",

If you are a Texas resident, tuition runs about $500 per hour, and minimum hours to be a full time student is 12 (pretty sure). That is $6000 for a semester or $12,000 for a year. Cheapest traditional housing and dining options will be around $18-20k for the year. That means you need about $32,000. That‚Äôs $3200 per month for 10 months. \n\nFirst, do you have anything to sell? Used car prices are high, books, furniture, clothes, etc all have some value. You got into UT, which means you have some wits about you. Get a traditional job, and work off hours doing something that pays cash. Babysitting over the summer can pay tons, tutoring a subject or teaching a musical instrument can also get you $100-$1000 per week, mow yards, wash windows, clean out trash cans (kids in my neighborhood make a killing charging $20 per house to spray out and clean the city trash bins), wash/detail cars, walk dogs. Whatever you can do, do it. At this point in your life, if you are awake, you should be hustling and making cash. \n\nPut your money in a bank account. Having cash in your mattress is outdated. Having a balance in your checking account shows a bank that you are a good candidate for credit. Learn about credit. It is not the all-evil venue that it is portrayed to be, but you HAVE to use it responsibly.\n\nOnce you get to campus, don‚Äôt stop grinding. Get on payment plans, look into programs for book and supplies aid. Be active in your dorm and get to know your RA/CA. Apply to be an RA/CA in your sophomore year. Many/most RA positions cover room and board. \n\nI‚Äôm not sure if many or any campus jobs are available to freshmen, but I know they are looking for people to work in the IDs department. \n\nFill out the FAFSA paperwork.

I went on a trip with an old HS friend a few years ago who told me he was still paying off college loans. He borrowed more for college than I used for a down payment on my first house!

        "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nI am new to applying for scholarships. The most experience I have is applying for a few no-essay ones. I've been looking at a lot of different websites and I was wondering if it is normal to need to sign up for tons of accounts to apply for scholarships. I feel like when I find a scholarship it always requires me to sign up for an account and then I end up receiving an excessive amount of emails. Is this normal? ",

            "body": "No essay ones are literally just lotteries.  Tens of thousands of people apply.\n\nMy son has won a few big ones on Scholarship America.  Usually they only take very specific, large award ones to manage so they take a bunch of time but if you win it‚Äôs worth it.\n\nKaleidoscope and  Going Merry our great ones because they simply list tons of individual scholarships, and then refer you to their webpages to actually apply.  same with fast web.  We have found a few on scholarship 360.\n\nBold and scholarship owl are more for small, easy to apply to scholarships .  Because they are small and easy to apply to, they get lots and lots of applications for each one.  It‚Äôs something to do when you have nothing else to apply to, but I wouldn‚Äôt put it as a priority ahead of others.\n\nDefinitely do a lot of googling your major and scholarship.  You will find quite a few scholarships that just aren‚Äôt listed on any of those scholarship search pages.  We have even used ChatGPT to find some although it tends to list the same ones over and over again. Get very creative with your search criteria if you use it and it may find one or two unique ones. \n\nThe biggest thing is to make it a bit of a job.  You need to apply to a lot of places in order to potentially win a few. Remember, everybody is applying for scholarships these days and the easier it is to find or to apply, the more people that apply to it. Things like applications that require multiple recommendations or videos tend to have fewer applicants. So if it‚Äôs hard to apply and it‚Äôs going to take a good amount of your time, it‚Äôs probably worth a try.  It doesn‚Äôt mean you will win them, but your chances are better.  My recommendation is setting aside several days a week where for a couple hours you look for scholarships and or/applied to them.",

Reply to the top-level comment with your pitch &amp; offer in the following format:\n\nKentucky offers Lavar Ball (1)\n\nScholarship\n\nSchool Visit (1 of 5)\n\nCoach Visit (1 of 3)\n\nPitch Goes Here\n\nImportant notes:\n\nValues and traits for recruits can be found on the sheet\n\nEvery coach/program starts each recruiting season with 5 school visits and 3 coach visits. These can be used on high-school recruits (of any rank), Graduate Transfers, JUCO players, or Cut Players (in CPR). Visits can be edited IN to your pitch until the recruit closes, but NEVER edited out. This is grounds for automatic disqualification.\n\nAll recruits stop accepting pitches (or edits) at their individual closing time. This closing time occurs when they reach the pre-assigned ‚Äúclose‚Äù time from the sheet, or when they have received no new offers in the last 24 hours, whichever occurs first.\n\nWhen a recruit reaches the final two hours before his closing time from the sheet, he will no longer accept any new offers. Beyond that two-hour mark only existing pitches can be edited.\n\nCopying and pasting pitch content from another pitch, whether your own or someone else‚Äôs, is grounds for disqualification. You may re-use small pieces in multiple pitches, but full sentences (or more) will not be allowed.\n\nAll four-star, five-star, graduate transfer, and JUCO prospects require a scholarship offer. Three-stars, two-stars, one-stars, zero-stars, and Cut Players can be offered walk-on spots or scholarships. Note that a scholarship offer (regardless of pitch quality) always beats a Preferred Walk-on (PWO), which always beats a walk-on offer.\n\nEach team is limited to 8 scholarship players and 13 total players. Signing players beyond these limits will require you to deny commitments or cut players, which may result in loyalty penalties. You should edit your pitch to rescind offers once you fill your desired roster spots. Please make your rescinded offer clear by - at a minimum - adding the word \"RESCINDED\" to the top of your post/reply. You may also strike through the Scholarship and even delete the pitch content, but please do not delete the entire post/reply and do not delete your visits.\n\nOur WIKI Page contains a wealth of information including pitching guides and walkthroughs from some of our most experienced coaches. Please take advantage of this resource.\n\nRemember, it is your responsibility to check the status of the players you offer on the sheet. The sheet is ALWAYS canon, and is the source of truth for a player's position, player's location, player's redshirt status, and more.",

            "body": "Temple offers Jason Drew\n\nScholarship\n\nAs I get up there in age, I think more and more about legacy. What have I done in the three decades since I began coaching that will be remembered three decades from now? There‚Äôs the most obvious one: winning Iowa State its first-ever championship in basketball. But is it enough? For a while, I thought it was, but I wouldn‚Äôt be chatting with you right now if I continued believing that. \n\nNo, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs enough. I‚Äôm proud of what I did with Iowa State, but I believe that I have more to contribute to the basketball world. I know that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre here, too, and I know that‚Äôs why you want to leave a lasting legacy not just in college but in the NBL. I want to help you do that. I want to get you into the NBL repping the cherry and white, and I want you to have a successful career in the NBL just like many of the players I coached with Iowa State have.\n\nIt's only natural that two of the cornerstones of my title-winning ISU team, Terrence Harris and Bostjan Lapornik, would go on to have the greatest careers of any Cyclone in the NBL. They already knew how to win on one of the sport‚Äôs biggest stages. They had won the always-competitive Big Ten Tournament and the National Tournament. They were better prepared than most kids coming out of college for the NBL‚Äôs intense grind, and I‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre just as prepared by having you lead a pro-offense and scheduling as many tough out-of-conference games and in-season tournaments as possible for us.\n\nYou can be the best Owl ever, the face of this program at the professional level, and it‚Äôs strongest advocate when I‚Äôm not here to advocate for the team myself anymore. You can be what Michael Jordan has been for UNC, what Jalen Brunson has been for Villanova, and what Harris and Lapornik have been for Iowa State. I know I can get you into the NBL, but it will be up to you to build your legacy from there, a legacy that I hope will include the words All-Star, All-NBL, and Champion.\n\nYou won‚Äôt have to travel far from your hometown of Janesville, Wisconsin to play for us, either. Since we‚Äôre a Big Ten school, we‚Äôre going to play schools like Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Iowa, so you‚Äôll have plenty of opportunities to return home during conference play.\n\nWe may be new to Division I, but we plan to win a lot of games, including games against big-name schools, during our first season. I‚Äôm going to surround you with elite defenders and shooters so that you can focus on what you do best, which is finding the open man and punishing teams that leave you open.\n\nYou don‚Äôt have to worry about me leaving for another school before I‚Äôve properly prepared you for the next stage of your career because I‚Äôm under contract for the next five years. My loyalty rating of 100 is a source of pride for me, so know that as long as you play for Temple, it will be with me as your coach.\n\nKnow that our prestige will be much higher by the time you leave this school than it is today, as I‚Äôve increased the prestige of every school I‚Äôve coached at. As we win games in the regular season and win CT and NT games, our prestige will rise and continue to rise.\n\nTemple also has a wide selection of majors to ensure that whatever you‚Äôre interested in, you‚Äôll be able to get a degree in it, whether it‚Äôs nuclear physics or dance theater. We also have resources available to ensure that even when you‚Äôre playing, you aren‚Äôt going to struggle in class at all. Our goal is to get you into the NBL, but if you do end up staying the four years or return later to get your degree, it will be worth something, and it will let you follow any dream you have.\n\nHope to talk to you again,\n\nCoach Jicem",

            "body": "I like scholarship owl and bold.org.  Write three 1000 word essays on volunteering, how you will help your community, and how a personal growth incident or story helped you decide what you want to do or will help you in college/the future.  Be as specific as possible about the stories, who you are, your activities.  Those three essays will fit 90% of your applications.  The jury is still out on ChatGPT so that's something you'll have to decide yourself.  You can certainly use it to expand or compress down to 500 words your essays and then rewrite.  Those scholarship platforms can seem scammy at first but keep digging into them, play around with your profile (which filters scholarship matches for you) and key word searches.  Look at all of the aggregators and dig into them and go up the learning curve.  Be prepared to do some short videos instead of essays but you can use ChatGPT to write a script for you.  Create a new email address just for applications.\n\nAlso, there's nothing wrong with loans and you are guaranteed $5500 a year in federal subsidized loans assuming your parents have good credit.  You can take additional loans as well based on need.  I understand student loan debt is a problem but if you take them and your income seriously they are manageable.  Some institutions or businesses will pay them off for you.  Consider federal government employment, despite the current environment for that.  Student loan repayment is often a benefit in public service.\n\nUniversity seems like a difficult thing to pay for but it isn't if you work hard and do your research.  Go to a state university.  Unless you are going to a top 50 private university there is no point going to a private university and paying extra for lifestyle or academics.  Many state schools are top tier as well.\n\nAlso, there are a TON of scholarships specifically for first gen students.",

For many, it is the first time they have access to a structured program with dedicated coaching and facilities. Training with ex-OWL players in collegiate also helps mentor the younger players.\n\nBlizzard should want Collegiate to succeed as the de facto Contenders league. It is effectively subsidizing OWCS and represents a path to pro for young players who don‚Äôt have wealthy parents, and sets them up to succeed post-OWCS by giving them access to an education. That gives younger players that are right now in middle and HS something to aspire to that is actually viable.\n\nIf all the big collegiate OW programs that offered scholarship support shutter their programs due to Blizzard‚Äôs lack of support and/or shortsightedness, the esport will collapse in NA. What orgs would want to stay involved? What players could afford to compete? Already the #3 team in the world only got $26K after all their hard work in Stage 1. And do you know what supported those players when they weren‚Äôt on a partnered team? They were all collegiate players.\n\nBlizzard seems like they are really making some great changes and are working hard to pivot to make OWCS successful, but it seems like they really dropped the ball on Collegiate this year with disastrous results.",

I'd really appreciate any advice people have, because I'm FGLI and have a lot of other qualities I try to highlight within most of my essays, but I keep getting rejection emails/not hearing back from scholarships. \n\nI feel like I've tried every trick in the book. I've written compelling hooks, had advisors critique my essays, spent weeks and months on some, and even prayed. But I'm getting really discouraged because no matter what I do, I never win any. It seems like everyone is low-income too, because when I'm applying to those, the competition is even worse. \n\nWhat advice do you have for a struggling scholarship applicant? ",

It‚Äôs too expensive, even the cheapest one costs a ton of money and I will feel like shit.\n\nBut like I said in the title, I am lost !!! The most common advice I get from people is filling as many scholarships as I can, even if it‚Äôs random. Now how do you do  it ? Do you go to a platform ? I guess the most common thing will be checking that with a counselor of my high school right ? Do you simply search for the scholarships in the career you are interested in? \n\nI know I am in the bottom of the abyss right know and because that I will appreciate any advise you can offer me.

            "body": "I like scholarship owl and bold.org.  Write three 1000 word essays on volunteering, how you will help your community, and how a personal growth incident or story helped you decide what you want to do or will help you in college/the future.  Be as specific as possible about the stories, who you are, your activities.  Those three essays will fit 90% of your applications.  The jury is still out on ChatGPT so that's something you'll have to decide yourself.  You can certainly use it to expand or compress down to 500 words your essays and then rewrite.  Those scholarship platforms can seem scammy at first but keep digging into them, play around with your profile (which filters scholarship matches for you) and key word searches.  Look at all of the aggregators and dig into them and go up the learning curve.  Be prepared to do some short videos instead of essays but you can use ChatGPT to write a script for you.  Create a new email address just for applications.\n\nAlso, there's nothing wrong with loans and you are guaranteed $5500 a year in federal subsidized loans assuming your parents have good credit.  You can take additional loans as well based on need.  I understand student loan debt is a problem but if you take them and your income seriously they are manageable.  Some institutions or businesses will pay them off for you.  Consider federal government employment, despite the current environment for that.  Student loan repayment is often a benefit in public service.\n\nUniversity seems like a difficult thing to pay for but it isn't if you work hard and do your research.  Go to a state university.  Unless you are going to a top 50 private university there is no point going to a private university and paying extra for lifestyle or academics.  Many state schools are top tier as well.\n\nA 3.7 unweighted GPA is very good.  If you have strong extra curriculars that's enough to get you into a top 20 university (like UVA for benchmark purposes because that's a uni I know), assuming you are taking mostly AP or IB courses to get you over 4.0 in your weighted GPA.\n\nAlso, do NOT do worse your first senior year semester.  Do better.  Universities like to see improvememt.  For real.  So if you get straight As your Fall semester you are golden.",

        "selftext": "### What started as..\n\nAn intention to make a great load order for myself, then to form a simple &amp; cohesive \"*Vanilla plus*\" mod list, to dedicating this to be an artistic work sewed to maximise general efficiency in the present Xbox modding age, to touch every aspect in the game as much as possible, at least *'significantly enough'* in a, similarly to the first step in this journey, simple &amp; cohesive, *enough*, way.. **around the mark of 30 days ago..**\n\n`Is approaching its finalisation with huge steps.`\n\n*If you are someone who stepped away from Skyrim on Xbox for a longer while, consider this post a service by me for you.*\n\nA load order intended to inspire &amp; to be useful to anyone who happens upon it, has pretty much caught up to the most recent advancements in this platform's capabilities, filling the complete 5 GB reservoir, attempting to approach &amp; edge the engine file handling limit while coming in at 240 `(maximum 243)` mod slots, around 450 *total mods* bundled up &amp;.. `indeed most importantly`, overhauling the game to be what it could have been if the ones who made this game did it led by actual leaders.. *A real RPG..* with *player agency, visual, audiological, narrative and interactive immersion, properly implemented gameplay elements with careful balancing put in play between them, and a great focus towards keeping it all playable &amp; 'cognitively recognizable',* ~~you know.~~\n_________________________________________\nI say this is it. This is *Skyrim 2* on Xbox, for as much as the temporary stage of the Xbox modding repertoire permits.\n\n`Full load order posted in comments.`\n\n`Screenshots throughout the journey, movies involving the load order &amp; other content, such as a general guide for how to handle modding on this platform of ours, available on my profile, mostly in the stickied posts.`\n_________________________________________\nA deep **thank you** to all you freestarts `(no free-ends)` who helped me get where we are now with this ambitious load order.\n\n*Without you, it would have taken significantly more time and sleepless nights..*\n_________________________________________\nAnd a deep **thank you** to the entire people of Skyrim modding for their support, in any way, shape or form. I love you!\n\nIf you are here looking for something truly special, you've found it.\n\nThis load order might receive a couple more changes.. and that's it for now. The vision is in place, all that remains is that.. `00.09%..`",

        "selftext": "Im 18, my sisters are 25 and 28. Growing up my mom (single mom, immigrant)expected less of me in regards to chores and responsibilities so in 2020 my sisters pulled away from responsibilities in the house entirely and since turning 16 I have recognized how unfair it and was and have completed built my own independence. I don't ask for rides, money and clean after myself and help my mom with legit everything. The dynamic has completely flipped to where everything in the house falls on me, which I am relatively fine with if it means my sisters can work on their personal life that has been hindered by the years they spent sacrificing for me. But me and my 26 y/o sister shared a room up until 2 years ago after we both tried the basement but ended up hating it because of the bugs. My sisters had their own rooms and I really hated the idea of sharing again. She suggested I temporarily make a room out of the walk in closet, which I agreed to. For a year I have been staying here with only my twin bed and nightstand and clothes. Neither of them have real plans of moving out I'm pretty sure. \n\nThe closet is connected to the only working shower by sliding door. When they shower they blast their music for usually an hour. The first time I asked for them to turn it down, my 28 y/o sister asked \"do you have somewhere to go tmrw morning?\" insinuating she doesn't wanna turn it down. Then another time my 25 y/o sister asked to unplug my lamp for her speaker and charger and I said \"no id be in the dark\" she said \"you can't be in the dark for 15 minutes?\" another example is when I was conflicted on my career choices my 28 y/o sister said \"well I feel like you have many options considering mom doesn't expect things from you\" or \"you\"ll be fine you don't have responsibilities anyway\" meanwhile months later I'm handling big things like our fridge being broke, figuring out dealerships for a new car, cleaning after them, while in nursing school. My mom also notices their rebellion so she solely asks me for help which is annoying but I sort of understand not asking people who don't want to help you. When I talk to other people in my life they think I'm insane for letting them say stuff like that to me but I really do feel sorry for the way the grew up because it affects their life now (no car, no friend groups, no husbands) so sometimes I'm okay with being a trauma punching bag ykwim? But lately the closet life is really getting to me between the stress of school and family, coming home to twin bed in closet feels like cinderella lol. I feel like they have gotten so comfortable with me doing everything in the house, while I deal with my own life and having no real bedroom that they justify being really ungrateful or invalidating towards me. It is really affecting my own mental health to stay in a closet but I am scared of their reaction.",

            "body": "# Interesting Takeaways Part 1 - About Joe Marsh &amp; T1\n\n**E-Sports as a Career**\n\n* **Breaking into the Industry:** Joe Marsh transitioned was unplanned from traditional comcast sports marketing intern to esports in 2017, joining Philadelphia Fusion OWL Team\n* **Investing in Talent:** T1 focuses on developing talent through initiatives like the Faker Scholarship. Modern esports players are treated like professional athletes, with dedicated physical therapists, mental coaches, and nutrition plans to optimize performance.\n* **Content Creation Challenges:** Pro players are often not natural content creators. Teams need to carefully manage storytelling and trust between players and content staff to produce engaging material.\n\n# T1 @ Worlds\n\n* **DDoS Issues:** Persistent DDoS attacks disrupted T1‚Äôs solo queue and fan interaction, affecting their income and preparation. Marsh criticized the lack of solutions to this problem.\n* **Zeus‚Äô Departure and Doran's Welcome:** T1 was committed to re-signing Zeus, but when that didn‚Äôt work out, they quickly pivoted to Doran. Marsh praised Doran‚Äôs work ethic and willingness to embrace T1‚Äôs high-pressure culture.\n* **Faker‚Äôs Longevity:** Faker continues to redefine expectations of player longevity, performing at an elite level well into his late 20s, defying the notion that esports players peak in their early 20s.\n* **Worlds as the Pinnacle:** Marsh noted that winning Worlds has the highest value in esports, not just financially but for legacy. Other tournaments, even MSI, don‚Äôt hold the same weight.\n* **Post-Match Bonding:** T1 emphasizes team dinners and bonding moments during competitions to build trust and reduce stress, with Haidilao dinners\n\n# Fan Engagement &amp; Branding\n\n* **Lifestyle Branding:** T1 has evolved beyond just a competitive team to a lifestyle brand with a focus on merchandise, fan platforms, and academy programs. Before Marsh‚Äôs tenure, fans couldn‚Äôt even purchase a T1 jersey. The team now has a robust merchandise strategy that includes partnerships and in-house products.\n* **Female Fandom:** \\*\\*\\*\"\\*\\*\\**You know, 85% of our venue was filled at our home game by our female fans. They support with their wallets, like they come out and force.\"* A significant portion of T1‚Äôs fanbase is female, which Marsh sees as a strength for live events and merchandise sales.\n* [Celebrating Players as Stars:](https://revoldiv.com/posts/f6160800-29e0-483e-a719-9898e4d9ec0b?time_to_highlight=00:16:02.08) Marsh emphasized the importance of treating players like celebrities, particularly in Korea, where they are viewed as cultural icons.\n* **Expanding Globally:** *\"We'd love to get at least 10 more in Korea in relatively short order, and then take that throughout Southeast Asia, whether it's Japan, Vietnam, Philippines, Singapore\"*\n\n# Gameplay &amp; Competition\n\n* **Meta vs. Playstyle:** T1 deliberately crafts strategies that align with their players‚Äô strengths rather than chasing global metas, which Marsh credits for their consistent success.\n* **The Guma-Keria Partnership:** Marsh praised Gumayusi and Keria‚Äôs synergy, emphasizing their unique ability to adapt and excel even when resources are scarce. Gumayusi‚Äôs mental resilience was highlighted as an essential factor for T1‚Äôs success, particularly when dealing with limited resources in high-pressure matches.\n* **Team Chemistry:** Marsh noted that championship teams are built through time, consistency, and trust, not just by signing the most talented players.\n* **Early Mistakes**: Initial 10-man roster strategy was challenging but helped identify top talent like Gumayusi, Keria, and Zeus",

            "body": "Interesting Takeaways Part 2 - Beyond T1, Insights on E-Sports Industry  \n*- Focusing more on q*uotes from Joe Marsh\n\n**1. Joe Marsh on LCK Cup**\n\n Joe Marsh also shared his¬†[thoughts¬†](https://youtu.be/M97E6oGP-nU?si=QifOXsmZ3Sy8ispU&amp;t=1140)(19:00) on¬†**LCK Cup**\n\n&gt;\n\n[full quote](https://youtu.be/M97E6oGP-nU?si=ptteWFYuCBNkTwbq&amp;t=2738)¬†(45:30) on competing in¬†**LCK Cup**\n\n&gt;\n\n**2. Esports Salaries and sustainability**\n\n‚ÄúThe average LCK salary in 2019 was $36,000 USD. That‚Äôs now ballooned to around half a million dollars.‚Äù\n\n**3. Issues with NA Esports Infrastructure**\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too expensive to live and operate in California. You‚Äôd find it cheaper to fly people to event destinations than to keep everyone in Santa Monica and pay California rates.‚Äù\n\n**4. Shift Toward International Formats (Key Highlight for me!)**\n\n‚ÄúEveryone cares about Worlds. Nobody wants to see T1 beating the bottom four LCK teams for months on end. Shrink the number of teams and focus on more international events.‚Äù\n\n\\- Joe Marsh proposed a shift from a locked regional play to a more global circuit structure, similar to **tennis or golf.** [(my own take on circuit style)](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1h6k90s/comment/m0f9r7d/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n**5. Creator-Led Teams Can Revitalize Esports**\n\n‚ÄúI also think this is my probably unpopular opinion, I think the creator led teams is super good for the game with Kameto and Karmine, what Caedrel is doing with Los Ratones and what Ludwig and Tyler1 could do with teams is great for the game‚Äôs health. They bring eyeballs and built-in audiences. ‚Äù\n\n**6. The Power of Fandom**\n\n‚ÄúDRX won Worlds, and they disbanded the next year. Winning isn‚Äôt enough. You need a fandom to support you afterward.‚Äù\n\n**7. Fixing Content Creation in Esports**\n\n‚ÄúContent for content‚Äôs sake doesn‚Äôt work. Just rolling cameras isn‚Äôt telling a story. Behind-the-scenes content and voice comms are what fans want‚Äîbut those are the hardest to produce because players and coaches don‚Äôt want to give away secrets.‚Äù\n\n**8. Esports Needs a New Talent Development Model**\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôd partner with colleges and build a feeder system, treating it like NCAA sports. Players could live in dorms, play, and study under scholarships.‚Äù",

ENJOY, GREAT BROTHERS &amp; SISTERS! THANK YOU FOR YOU!**\n_________________________________________\n## Nature of the Wild Lands/Wildlands Renewal revision summary;\n\nNew textures, new forests, new roads, even more content, such as, and such isn't limited to.. a stronger werewolf curse presence in the world, a one that makes sense lore-wise. New knowledge too ~ the modding guide thread has been updated - scroll down to find a link to it.\n_________________________________________\n\n   ~\n\nDo you want a *great* modded Skyrim experience packed in one box together with the convenience of a console..\n\n   But you are unwilling or perhaps unable to go through days of seeing what works &amp; what doesn't, just to start your playthrough and run into SHIT, causing you to commit even more to your mod list and load order, often.. **again and again**.. unsuccessfully?\n\n   Regardless if you are or aren't one of these people..\n..here's my take on *grandure*, with.. Vanilla.. **MASSIVE**.. PLUS. FOR YOU. THE COMMUNITY, to cherish and hold dear &amp; to inspire yourselves with at every step.\n\n*Full list* &amp; *load order* in Google Sheets;\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kxL9r_RCflzFScMkexvJA8Z9QR4qI5H66Ly-kvk6nu8/edit?usp=drivesdk\n\n237 plugins `+3 optional ones highlighted in the load order document) = 240 in total`, **and a few up to personal preference**, 450+ actual mods contained in bundles, all fully patched &amp; functioning in unison.\n\n`(This is done mindfully to not exceed the \"243\" mark, at which the game may start having issues. Staying below that is advised.)`\n\n     Most stable on Series S/X.\nOne S w/o a SSD might have occasional frame drops due to low VRAM `(which is easily solved by restarting the console)`, otherwise all three run it flawlessly.\n\n**SE is advised.** *AE versions/patches for most mods here exist - if you are struggling to find one, let me know by commenting, I'll help!*\n\n‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã\n\n**ALL** Skyrim aspects overhauled or changed to a degree in a lore-accepted, well balanced way.\n\nNo enormous world changes that might veer far from the conceptual essence `The Elder Scrolls V` carries.\n\n   Instead, space has been made to bring a **FRESH** smell to the air with the **significant** parts within this mod list;\n\n   ..mods redoing all known gameplay elements, adding weapons, armor, revamping unique items, giving access to new followers abiding by a better framework, expanding &amp; adding quest lines, revisiting popular areas, enhancing atmospherics...\n\n           ..in short summary..\n\n   ..**Extended Encounters** &amp; **Radiance** to bring an adventurous (risky, perhaps?) sense to your travels,\n\n   ..**DAWN V2**, **Wildlands Renewal** *with* **Nature of the Wild Lands**, **LUX, LUX Via &amp; Orbis**, **City Trees AiO** &amp; **Flagrantly Plagerized Graphics Overhaul** *with* some **tailored LoD** to bring more beauty,\n\n   ..**Open World Loot** &amp; other *perfectly* sewn together leveled lists/encounter zones to let the progression &amp; world feeling be more organic..\n\n   ..**CFPAO**, **ESCO**, **GDB'S: Elden Beast Edition** and various enemy overhauls paired in compatibility and consistency to form a marvelous &amp; modular all-in-one animation, combat, movement, enemy AI, loot.. *AND MORE*.. rework.\n\n   ..a total &amp; EPIC dragon remake (God knows we needed that..),\n\n   an audio `(Dolby Atmos supported)` &amp; music `(Norse inspired)` retouch to let the provincial climate seep through your expensive sound system on a scale grander than before,\n\n   **Skyrim Reputation**, **Wintersun**..\n\n   AND SO, SO MUCH MORE! Don't worry, \n     quests have been touched too, \n           **extensively.**\n\n   ~                                 \n\nAll in all, all elements have been furthered in extensive ways, all while keeping Skyrim true to its concepts.\n\n   ..still nostalgic.. but SUPER FRESH, more playable &amp; immersive to boot? WHERE DO I SIGN UP!?\n\nIncludes **Racial Body Morphs**, **Modular Clothing System**, **Sos Ahst Mulaag** &amp; **Serendipitous** paired with **No Pain, No Gain**, which, combined and patched with other carefully selected mods here, makes for a character development overhaul that truly makes you feel more like you're playing a real roleplaying game.\n\n   You decide what you want to be, no more **\"Jack of All Trades\"**, now it's time to step into your *DREAM* build. Paladin/archer &amp; enchanter? Destructive `(as destructive as a combination of Odin, Triumvirate &amp; Kittytail's best spell selection can make one)` steel-clad mage with an affinity for smithing? A menacing vampire using **ancient blood magic**? A **brutal** WEREBEAST? All while keeping that **DRIP INTACT?**\n\n   ## The possibilities have no end, but so don't the consequences. Your choices matter. Choose wisely.\n\n   ~\n\nConstructive criticism on this beautiful list is always appreciated &amp; loved! See something and think it's changeable/furtherable in a positive direction? Tell me!\n\n**Extra care has been taken to avoid community-wide known problematic mods with dirty edits or unwanted changes.**\n\n*MASSIVE thanks &amp; kudos to the brothers &amp; sisters in the community who helped with this! I posted the relevant community links in the comments.*\n\n**Total stability ensues..!**\n\n‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã=‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè‚âà‚óã‚âà‚óè\n\nIf you're one with the beautiful people installing it, make sure that you download the mods from the biggest to the smallest, until you reach ones that are below 1 MB. All creation downloads on Xbox require DOUBLE space to queue, hence why. `(This is important with this modlist, as it takes up almost all 5 GB.)`\n\n   **To do so, confer with this download order here:**\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t_Vw87fWuc0tKNbr8-xY9q3_w68eJI-d_QAIL2Bpajc/edit?usp=drivesdk\n\n`(ALTERNATIVELY, you can do the following; first clear your Bethnet library completely, add 70 (limit) mods starting from the top o' the download order document, go to the in-game Creations menu and hit \"Download all Creations from my library\" and download the rest manually, or do the same as above until you have everything installed - this speeds up the process significantly, if you do it fast enough.)`\n\n   ~\n\n### If not, here are some pointers;\n\n..when downloading, disable the mod you just installed before moving on to the next. Enable all one by one later, from top to bottom, in the load order menu when you finish reordering them **while offline** according to the *load order document.* This practice will prevent most of decreasing engine stability and lessen crashes as the plugin count comes into the upper 150s.\n\n*When searching for a mod, only search for one word related to it.* **Why?** The Bethnet search engine searches for all mods attributed to all words you enter as a query.\n\nDon't be afraid when your game crashes or you get a *\"Can't connect to servers\"* error. Both are safe ~ when it crashes, simply reopen Skyrim.\n\n   **Refer here for a full guide on how to go offline and order correctly &amp; more general advice**;\n\n   https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyrimModsXbox/comments/1iiyp23/repost_general_xbox_modding_advice_thread_for_you/\n\n   ~\n\nMake sure to look down in the comments for a subthread compiling all recent changes/updates to the load order! All alterations are forwarded to both documents as well.\n\n   *Or.. make it easier on yourself by following this link;*\n\n https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyrimModsXbox/comments/1i6nt95/comment/m8dqcum/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb3x&amp;utm_name=mweb3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button\n\n`Many updates were omitted in the mini-thread due to excessive changes/forgetting, however, both Sheets documents are up to date.`\n\n   ~\n\n_________________________________________\nLastly, in the *load order* document are also included general tips, just before the ordered mod list, for successfully operating a console-modded Skyrim game &amp; also mod list related advice.\n_________________________________________\nThe whole list is filled to the brim with descriptions for relevant mods or advice on how to operate them, too.\n_________________________________________\nAND there is optional support for full **Chesko**'s **Campfire** &amp; **Frostfall** integration, as outlined in the beginning - this will require 3 mod slots, leaving the total at **240**.\n\n **Campfire** &amp; **Frostfall** implement flawlessly made *hypothermia, warmth* and *camping* mechanics into the game. **Chesko** actually went on to become an official Bethesda developer!\n\n   *Enjoy, my great brothers &amp; sisters!*\n\n**And remember, your smiles make me smile.** :)\n_________________________________________\n‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢\n\n\nThis is only the beginning to the manifesting¬†**MASSIVE! things** series. Future projects may include things I am ambitious about, such as mods with an emphasis on questing/rewards from exploration &amp; finding new things/adding things to find &amp; discover in the game.. and.. other things that are worth the \"MASSIVE!\" namesake.\n\n¬† ¬†**Stay tuned for more from abundantinlight!**\n\n‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢\n_________________________________________",

Sorry to hear your situation, try reaching out to your school to ask for emergency grants too etc. I once asked for an additional increase and was rejected, then I tried again and rewrote another email and was granted an increase.

It was so difficult for me to mug up this much as I was always keep it calm kind of student and never had interest in govt job, which I still don‚Äôt. \nBut this exam is landmark and need to achieve success so what I did? \nI still remember my first day of preparation‚Ä¶\nI solved the PYQ and got to know how much I already know. Which was quite less as no university covers the exact syllabus of NET ENGLISH. \nFor a year I was juggling between books YouTube channels and online free education if available. But no use. \nI had a very old college professor who died recently I asked him for help \nHe made me a list of few books and also provided some second hand books. \nI stared reading it specially in night as I m a night owl and it helps me think. \nFirst reading was only to understand what the hell is this all about. From second I started minimising the data but never burdened my brain that I have to learn it all. Soon I was able to recall and understand. Then once the notes were made made a time table to JUST CASUALLY read it every Third day. \nBrain feels scared and burdened until it‚Äôs unfamiliar with the data. Once you started giving it the data every few days it becomes habitual. \nThen I solved the PYQS again and this time brain just knew how to eliminate the wrong. \nAnd that led to correct answer. \nPlus I started to understand from where the questions are coming from. \nThe I started my serious revision thinking let‚Äôs polish the knowledge and started learning in 1 hr cycle and 10 mints break in which I used CHATGPT to make MCQS for me In 4 stages -easy- moderate- difficult- ultra difficult \n\nI trained my brain for 7-8 months and appeared for first NET and qualified for PHD only as some marks were less in scoring NET \nAt that time I also knew what I m lacking and stared studying theory and criticism. Then I was more confident. This time the paper was too difficult but the previous study and the theory criticism helped me a lot. \nNow I have to focus on linguistic üòÖ \nI want to do PhD and I need scholarship for that. That is the only reason for my success in this exam. I can‚Äôt afford private institutions and I bloody need a scholarship üòÖ",

I've calculated I'll end highschool with around a 3.0/3.2 GPA which isn't super great.\n\nI really want to find a college that has a pretty campus, but I feel like most colleges that are really pretty are very selective and hard to get into OR insanely expensive (like Lewis and Clark). All I really want is a cozy college with a great student life in a nice town and I feel like that's been kinda hard to find. Really need one with mid/high acceptance rates too :/\n\nSome colleges I've *somewhat* been considering include CU Boulder and Appalachian State. If you can't tell I really like pretty views and don't wanna be in a gross insanely modern college.\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions or can share any knowledge about colleges that fit that description, please please please let me know!\n\n\nEDIT : thanks to everybody that responded!! for the people commenting about my budget, not gonna get too in detail about it but it's hard to say an exact number because my parents are separated and one has a very high income and one is literally completely broke. I'm moving in with the higher income one who lives in NC next summer who has some money saved up for me, just don't know how much so plspls dont give me a hard time about it :(\n\nThanks again!!",

The non-essay scholarships are more lottery scholarships, so you might get lucky, but it's not a great gameplay.\n\n2nd: 2 weeks is too short of a turnaround. Most scholarships are 2-4 months before you hear anything. Look for announcement dates.\n\n3rd: keep applying to good ones. If you aren't winning, have someone look at your essays, they are key. Once college starts, build relationships with your professors, my son was recommended by 3 professors for departmental scholarships.\n\nI am including my list of places that we liked for finding scholarships.\n\nMy son was somewhat successful. These are some of my suggestions. Also, note that while some of these are databases, not all databases are the same.

            "body": "Not all, but some scholarships have minimum gpa requirements. If you can get it above 2.5, a lot more will be open to you. \n\nMy son was somewhat successful. These are some of my suggestions. Also, note that while some of these are databases, not all databases are the same. Everything listed I personally used for my son.\n\nI don't like Bold or ScholarshipOwl, and my son rarely did the no essay scholarships.\n\nI like:\nScholarships.com\n\nScholarship360\n\nFastweb\n\nScholarship America\n\nKaleidescope\n\nJLV Counseling Scholarships\n\nDiscover has a huge list\n\nGoing Merry\n\nTUN Scholarships\n\nEmail: Monica Matthews has a monthly list-also has an excellent ebook to walk you through the process\n\nEmail: Dave the Scholarship Coach at Scholarship GPS has a daily scholarship-does essay review and has an excellent video course. \n\nAlso, check professional organizations related to your major. They give huge discounts to students and many times have scholarships available only to members. My son won one of these, and they also offered him mentorship with people in their industry, networking, and help navigating college for 2 years.",
